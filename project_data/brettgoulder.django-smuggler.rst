Django Smuggler
===============

**Django Smuggler** is a pluggable application for `Django Web Framework`_ for
you easily dump/load fixtures via the automatically-generated administration
interface. Especially useful for transporting data in production for the
development project and vice versa, but can also be used as a backup tool.

.. _`Django Web Framework`: http://www.djangoproject.com


Installing & Setup
==================

Smuggler is in the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`_ and you can easily install
the latest stable version of it using the tools ``pip`` or
``easy_install``. Try::

  pip install django-smuggler

or::

  easy_install django-smuggler

.. _`Python Package Index (PyPI)`: http://pypi.python.org


Alternatively, you can install Smuggler from source code running the follow
command on directory that contains the file ``setup.py``::

  python setup.py install

After installation you need configure your project to recognizes the Smuggler
application adding ``'smuggler'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and setup
the project *URLConf* like follow::

  urlpatterns = patterns('',
      # ...
      (r'^admin/', include('smuggler.urls')), # put it before admin url patterns
      (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
  )

Then try access these urls:

* `/admin/load/ <http://127.0.0.1/admin/load/>`_, to load data from uploaded
  files or files on SMUGGLER_FIXTURE_DIR;

* `/admin/dump/ <http://127.0.0.1/admin/dump/>`_, to download data from
  whole project;

* `/admin/APP_LABEL/dump/ <http://127.0.0.1/admin/APP_LABEL/dump/>`_, to
  download data from a app;

* `/admin/APP_LABEL/MODEL_LABEL/dump/
  <http://127.0.0.1/admin/APP_LABEL/MODEL_LABEL/dump/>`_, to download data
  from a model;

If you can access the URLs above, the application was setup correctly. Note
that these URLs are accessible only by superusers.

Smuggler also provides a template to show buttons for dump and load data on
change list page (``change_list.html``). You can setup the ModelAdmin you are
interested like follow::

    class ExampleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        change_list_template = 'smuggler/change_list.html'
        ...

*Note: on directory "etc/sample_templates/" you have some template examples
to put Smuggler's buttons on app indexes and admin index page.*

Settings
--------

Smuggler has the following settings available. You can set them in your project
``settings.py``. If you doesn't set them it will assume the default values:

SMUGGLER_EXCLUDE_LIST
    List of models to be excluded from dump. Use the form 'app_label.ModelName'.
    Default: [].
                                
SMUGGLER_FIXTURE_DIR
    Saved files will be stored on this directory. The signal
    ``smuggler.signals.save_data_on_filesystem`` uses this value too.
    Default: None.

SMUGGLER_FORMAT
    Format for dumped files. 'json' and 'xml' are supported.
    Default: 'json'.

SMUGGLER_INDENT
    Indentation for dumped files.
