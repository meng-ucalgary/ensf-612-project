# PHP Beginner Book
The PHP Beginner book is a collaborative writing project by Boston PHP.

## Our philosophy
The PHP Beginner book is designed to get people learning PHP by explaining concepts in a very easy to understand way, as well as giving them small challenges to use and apply what they are learning.

A fundamental flaw in all the books I have seen, is that they teach you what to do step by step. The learner never has to think for themselves. My belief is that you cannot actually teach something to anyone, what you should do is provide them experiences for them to learn. 

The point is to give the reader an experience to learn

## Why write another PHP book?
There are lots of books out there that teach you the PHP language by syntax, with examples and code that you have to type or paste. Frankly, I am tired of this approach and it is boring for the learner. I have met many would-be PHP developers that have read books, gone through training, tutorials, and other types of approaches and they still don't learn.
 
This book takes a different approach. I will teach you by giving you small development challenges. You will work on these development challenges and learn by seeing and doing. It is a unique and fun way to learn that will get you coding faster, since you are applying what you learn step by step.
