# Swagger Editor

Swagger Editor lets you edit API specifications in YAML inside your browser and to preview documentations in real time.
Valid Swagger JSON descriptions can then be generated and used with the full Swagger tooling (code generation, documentation, etc).

To understand how it works, you should [try the live demo](http://editor.swagger.io/#/edit)!

### YAML Syntax
The editor supports the usage of the more human-friendly YAML format (used by default). Since JSON and YAML are interchangeable, the YAML structure correlates 1:1 with the JSON spec. To use with the other Swagger domain tools, simply execute `File -> Download JSON` and it will produce the converted JSON file.

The editor opens with an example YAML file for your convenience. For some other examples see '[Creating Swagger JSON from YAML files](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/Creating-Swagger-JSON-from-YAML-files)'.

### Importing your Swagger document
You can import both Swagger 2.0 documents into Swagger Editor. Click **File** menu and select one of import methods. You can import both YAML and JSON of Swagger 2.0 documents.
You can also import an existing YAML or JSON Swagger 2.0 specs document by using the `import` query parameter in edit mode. For example:
```
http://editor.swagger.io/#/?import=http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml
```

## Why "Try this operation" is not working?

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor.git
cd swagger-editor
npm start
```

That's it! This will open a browser window running current development version. It will reload the app if you make changes to source files.
