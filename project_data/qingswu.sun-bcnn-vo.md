# Sun-BCNN
Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network to infer Sun Direction from a single RGB image, trained on the KITTI dataset [1].

## Installation & Pre-Requisites

1. Download and compile [Caffe-Sl](https://github.com/wanji/caffe-sl) (we use their L2Norm layer).

2. Ensure that the **lmdb** and **cv2** python packages are installed (e.g. through pip).

3. Clone sun-bcnn:
```
git clone https://github.com/utiasSTARS/sun-bcnn-vo.git
```

## Testing with pre-trained model
1. Visit ftp://128.100.201.179/2016-sun_bcnn and download a pre-trained model, test LMDB file and appropriate mean file.

2. Edit *caffe-files/test_sunbcnn.sh* to match appropriate mean file, weights file and testing file.  Edit *scripts/test_sunbcnn.py* with appropriate directories.

3. Run *scripts/test_sunbcnn.sh*:
```
bash scripts/test_sunbcnn.sh
```

## Training
### Using KITTI data
1. Visit ftp://128.100.201.179/2016-sun_bcnn and download the training LMDB file. Visit http://vision.princeton.edu/pvt/GoogLeNet/Places/ and download the pre-trained GoogLeNet from Princeton (trained on MIT Places data).

2. Edit *caffe-files/train_sunbcnn.prototxt* with the appropriate file names (search 'CHANGEME')

3. Edit *caffe-files/train_sunbcnn.sh* with the appropriate folder and file names.

4. Run *scripts/train_sunbcnn.sh*:
```
bash scripts/train_sunbcnn.sh
```

Note: the LMDB files contain images that have been re-sized and padded with zeros along with target Sun directions (extracted through ephemeris tables and the ground truth provided by KITTI GPS/INS). A human readable table of image filenames and Sun directions can be found in the kitti-groundtruth-data folder (consult our paper for camera frame orientation).

### Using your own data
See *scripts/create_lmdb_sunbcnn_dataset.py* for a wireframe of how to create your own training LMDB files.
