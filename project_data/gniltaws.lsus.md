Patch Management Dashboard
===============
Patch Management Dashboard does one thing, but it does it well:
* Monitors for needed patches on your nodes.

~~In a future release (Hopefully sometime in August), it will give you the ability to suppress patches on
a per-server or a global basis, as well as tell the system to install a single package, or fully update a
server.~~ **Suppression is complete everywhere except the UI. If you want to add a suppressed package, you can do so with a command similar to this:**

Single server named 'some server'

```
INSERT INTO `supressed` (`package_name`,`server_name`) VALUES('some_package','some-server');
```

Global Suppression

```
INSERT INTO `supressed` (`package_name`,`server_name`) VALUES('some_package',0);
```

Compatible with: Debian Wheezy+/Ubuntu 10.04+/CentOS 5.x+/Red Hat EL5+/Fedora FC19+

Install
===============

To install:

* simply clone this git (git clone https://github.com/PatchDashboard/patchdashboard)
* cd into patchdashboard (cd /opt/patchdashboard)
* run install.sh (./install.sh)

It will ask you some questions. Simply provide the answers, or accept the default answers found in the "[]" boxes
If it does not have anything in "[]", you must provide an answer.

Finally To add a node:
* run "/opt/patch_manager/add_server.sh"
 * follow instructions

On each node:

If you want to do the push method, follow the instructions below.
* make sure root can log in, and is not blocked by sshd_config directives
* if root cannot log in (their password is hashed, but SSH allows them), make sure to copy the contents of "id_rsa.pub" in /root/.ssh into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on each node
 * after adding the shared key, from the patch server, ssh into the node as root to make sure the keypair works.
* if root can log in (they have a password set), run this from the patch server:
 * ssh-copy-id root@SERVER_IP (change SERVER_IP to the nodes IP address)

If you want to use the easier pull method:
* go to your PatchDashboard Web UI
* Click on "Add a Server"
* Follow the second set of instructions, which will look something like this
  * "run the following on each node"
    * "curl https://1.1.1.1/client/client_installer.php|bash"
