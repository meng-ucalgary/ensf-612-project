# nx-compile

This library is part of the [NX framework](http://nx-framework.com).

The purpose of this library is to allow the execution of strings as code in the
context of an object. It combines ES6 Proxies with the JavaScript `with` keyword to achieve this.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @risingstack/nx-compile
```

## Platform support

- Node: 6 and above
- Chrome: 49 and above (after browserified)
- Firefox: 38 and above (after browserified)
- Safari: 10 and above (after browserified)
- Edge: 12 and above (after browserified)
- Opera: 36 and above (after browserified)
- IE is not supported

## Usage

```js
const compiler = require('@risingstack/nx-compile')
```

## API

### compiler.compileCode(String)

This method creates a function out of a string and returns it. The returned function takes
an object as argument and executes the string as code in the context of the passed object.
The string can be any valid javascript code.

```js
const code = compiler.compileCode('return prop1 + prop2')
const sum = code({prop1: 1, prop2: 2}) // sum is 3
```

The returned function also accepts a second object argument, that may contain temporary variables.
Temporary variables are added to the context object while the code is executing and removed after.
They are favored over the permanent context variables.

```js
const code = compiler.compileCode('return prop1 + prop2')
const context = {prop1: 1, prop2: 2}
const temporary = {prop1: 2}
const sum = code(context, temporary) // sum is 4, context is still {prop1: 1, prop2: 2}
```

### compiler.compileExpression(String)

This method creates a function out of a string and returns it. The returned function takes
an object as argument and executes the string as an expression in the context of the passed object.
It returns the result of the evaluated expression. The string can be any javascript expression
that may come after a return statement.

```js
const expression = compiler.compileExpression('prop1 || prop2')
const result = expression({prop2: 'Hello'}) // result is 'Hello'
```

Expressions return undefined instead of throwing a TypeError on invalid property access.
This allows lazy initialization of your data.

```js
const expression = compiler.compileExpression('item.name')
const context = {}

let result = expression(context) // result is undefined, no error is thrown

context.item = {name: 'item name'}
result = expression(context) // result is 'item name'
```

### compiler.expose(String, String, String, ...)

Use this method to expose globals to the compiler. Non of the globals are exposed by default.

```js
const code = compiler.compileCode('console.log(Math.round(num))')
compiler.expose('console', 'Math')
code({num: 1.8}) // logs 2 to the console
```

Context variables are always favored over global ones, when both are present (with the same name).

### compiler.hide(String, String, String, ...)

Use this method to hide exposed globals from the compiler.

```js
const code = compiler.compileCode('console.log(Math.round(num))')
compiler.expose('console', 'Math')
code({num: 1.8}) // logs 2 to the console
compiler.hide('console', 'Math')
code({num: 1.8}) // throws an error, console and Math are undefined
```

Context variables are always favored over global ones when both are present (with the same name).

## Example

```js
const compiler = require('@risingstack/nx-compile')

compiler.expose('console')
const context = {name: 'nx-compile'}
const tempVars = {version: '4.2.0'}
const code = compiler.compileCode('console.log(name + version)')

code(context, tempVars) // outputs 'nx-compile4.2.0' to console
```

## Contributions

This library has the very specific purpose of supporting the
[NX framework](https://github.com/RisingStack/nx-framework).
Features should only be added, if they are used by the framework. Otherwise please fork.

Bug fixes, tests and doc updates are always welcome.
Tests and linter (standardJS) must pass.
