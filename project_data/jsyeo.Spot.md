#Spot

Simple Spotify-powered tunes for your office.

![](https://github.com/minton/Spot/raw/master/resources/Diagram.gif)

##Origins

This project is heavily inspired by [Play](https://github.com/play/play). Which is an awesome iTunes-based solution.

##Requirements

*   OS X
*   Spotify > 0.8
*   (Slack, Campfire, or HipChat) with Hubot (optional but recommended)

##Setup

Install https://www.spotify.com. <--See [#19](https://github.com/minton/Spot/pull/19#issuecomment-78389706)

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/minton/Spot.git && cd Spot

Install gems:

    bundle install

Set Up Environment Variables:

To provide a link to your audio stream in the web interface, define an environment variable `SPOT_FEED_URL`

    ```
    export SPOT_FEED_URL="//your/audio/feed/listen.m3u"
    ```

Start Spot:

    rake start

The server will start up here: [localhost:5051](http://localhost:5051).

Spotify will open and `Repeat` and `Shuffle` will be turned on.

You should now open your favorite playlist or radio station.

##Airplay Support

You'll need to `Enable access for assistive devices` in System Preferences for this to work.

##Usage

Spot can technically be used by any client capable of GET/PUT/POST requests as described below but it was really designed to be controlled via [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/) in [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/). You can find the latest Spot Hubot script here: [Spot.coffee](https://raw.github.com/github/hubot-scripts/master/src/scripts/spot.coffee).
