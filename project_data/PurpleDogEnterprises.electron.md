This is the repository for my course: [Electron: Building Cross Platform Desktop Apps](https://www.lynda.com/Electron-tutorials/Electron-Building-Cross-Platform-Desktop-Apps/518051-2.html). You can watch the full course at Lynda.com.

Electron is an open-source framework for creating desktop applications with your favorite web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It makes it easy to create a simple app with a few lines of code, using languages you already know. Want to learn more? Join Ray Villalobos as he walks through the techniques you need to master cross-platform desktop development with Electron. Learn how to configure and communicate between app windows (aka webpages) via the main and renderer processes, and integrate the React and Bootstrap frameworks to build interfaces with multiple panels and custom menus. As a final step, Ray shows how to package your project into a standalone, clickable app that can be run on Windows, Mac, or Linux machines.

### Topics include:
- Creating your first app
- Configuring multiple windows and window events
- Integrating React.js
- Creating external components
- Passing events through props
- Saving data
- Using Bootstrap components in Electron
- Creating a multipanel app
- Creating custom menus
- Packaging the application
