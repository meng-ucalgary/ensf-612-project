Python tool project 

<h3>Motivation</h3>

Building a strong database backend has become a very common task for programmers. It has not been an easy task to write raw SQL statements, run them and store the results as an array of records. This method has not only been tedious but prone to various errors. However, programmers today can write Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) programs to avoid this outdated method of using data from databases when using any object-oriented programming language. ORM is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible systems in object-oriented programming languages. The SQLAlchemy library takes part in solving this problem many programmers have faced in the past while using Python. SQLAlchemy’s ORM includes a method of relating user-defined Python classes with database tables as well as instances of those classes with rows in their corresponding tables. This library is similar to sqlite3 in some things; however, SQLAlchemy’s code is distinguishable as it is more object-oriented and easier to read and keep. Besides, one can easily create, read, update and delete SQLAlchemy objects as if they were normal Python objects. We believe this library would bring upon our classmates and us an additional set of skills to simplify our tasks when working with databases, which is why it is important for all of us to know about it so that we can use our time more efficiently.

SQLAlchemy is used by organizations such as:
 
- Yelp!
- The OpenStack Project
- Reddit
- Mozilla
- Survey Monkey
- FreshBooks
- Fedora Project

<h3> Summary and Personal Assessment </h3>

As mentioned in various sections above, SQLAlchemy proves to be a useful library as it facilitates various tasks for programmers who work heavily with databases. The library has a flexible design, which makes it easy to write complex queries. It also has enterprise-levels APIs, which makes the code adaptable and strong. It also has some disadvantages like its steep learning curve; however, overall it seems to be an efficient and time saving library to be familiar with.  

We believe SQLAlchemy is a useful library when it comes to applications that are heavily  dependent on databases. This opinion relies heavily on the fact the library optimizes the database interactions by clubbing queries together instead of flushing the data to the DB every single time (meaning write operations are done only when there is read operation). Also, it is very easy to manipulate data in the object-oriented programming way. 

In addition to that, SQLAlchemy is a very powerful and useful package for Data Analysts. This is because it allows users to define the database schema in Python code in the form classes which keeps related functionalities together and facilitates easy maintenance. The syntax allows you to mix SQL clauses and Python variables, and is secure against SQL injection attacks. This package allows seamless integration with web frameworks and can easily be customized based on user needs.
