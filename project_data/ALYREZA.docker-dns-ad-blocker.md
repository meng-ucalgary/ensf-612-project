# oznu/dns-ad-blocker

A simple, lightweight, Dnsmasq DNS server to block traffic to known ad servers.

## Usage

Quick Setup:

```
docker run -d --restart=always -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp oznu/dns-ad-blocker
```

You can now set your devices to use the Docker Host's IP Address as the primary DNS resolver,
if you are using [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) or [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) this will be 127.0.0.1.

Automatic blacklist updates are enabled by default. This should only be used on conjunction with a
[restart policy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies---restart) as the container is killed
when an update is available to refresh Dnsmasq.

## Parameters

```shell
docker run -d --restart=always
  -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp
  -e DEBUG=0
  -e NS1=8.8.8.8-e NS2=8.8.4.4
  -e AUTO_UPDATE=1
  -e BRANCH=master
  -v </path/to/config>:/etc/dnsmasq.d/
  oznu/dns-ad-blocker
```

The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side.

* ```--restart=always``` - ensure the container restarts automatically after an update, **required**.
* ```-p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp``` - expose port 53 on TCP and UDP to the host, **required**.
* ```-e DEBUG``` - enables debug mode if set to ```DEBUG=1```. For verbose logging (including source IP) set ```DEBUG=2```.
* ```-e NS1 -e NS2``` - override the default forward lookup servers. By default these are set to Google's DNS servers.
* ```-e AUTO_UPDATE``` - to disable automatic updates to the blacklist set ```AUTO_UPDATE=0```. Automatic updates are enabled by default.
* ```-e BRANCH``` - set the branch or commit to use for the blacklist. Defaults to master.
* ```-v /etc/dnsmasq.d/``` - any files included in the mounted volume will be included in the Dnsmasq config. See below.

## AD Blocking

This image is using the blacklists created by [oznu/dns-zone-blacklist](https://github.com/oznu/dns-zone-blacklist) and [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

The DNS server works by returning ```0.0.0.0``` when a DNS lookup is made by a browser or device to a blacklisted domain. ```0.0.0.0``` is defined as a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non applicable target which results in the browser rejecting the request.

If you have found a host you think should be blacklisted please submit an issue on the upstream blacklist, [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues), as
the aim of this project is not to maintain yet another blacklist.

## Optional :: Custom Domains

This image supports adding additional zones that may be used to serve internal DNS zones or to override existing zones.

To do this create a volume share when creating the container:

```
docker run -d -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp -v /srv/zones:/etc/dnsmasq.d/ oznu/dns-ad-blocker
```

Every file in the ```/srv/zones``` will be included as an extension to the Dnsmasq config.

Example:

```
# Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
# The example below send any host in doubleclick.net to a local
# webserver.
address=/doubleclick.net/127.0.0.1

# Return an MX record named "maildomain.com" with target
# servermachine.com and preference 50
mx-host=maildomain.com,servermachine.com,50
```

After adding or updating a zone config file you must restart the container for it to be loaded.
