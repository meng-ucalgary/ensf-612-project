# Flock

A secure contact and calendar syncing application for Android.

Flock is a replacement for the default contact and calendar synchronization services provided by Google. Flock provides end-to-end encryption
between multiple Android devices putting the privacy of your contacts and calendars back under your control. To facilitate syncing between
multiple devices a "sync service" is required, this can be any standards compliant WebDAV server that conforms to the following RFCs:

1. RFC 2518 - HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring -- WEBDAV
2. RFC 4918 - HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
3. RFC 6352 - CardDAV: vCard Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
4. RFC 4791 - Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)

The Android app can be downloaded through [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock) or via our
[alternative distribution channel](https://flock-supplychain.anhonesteffort.org/packages/org.anhonesteffort.flock/current). Note that the
certificate presented by our alternative distribution channel is signed by the same private certificate authority pinned by [Flock's trust store](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Flock/blob/master/flock/src/main/assets/flock.store).
