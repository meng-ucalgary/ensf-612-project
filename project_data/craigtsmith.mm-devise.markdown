# MongoMapper for Devise

*mm-devise* will let you use [devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) with [MongoMapper](http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper). 

*mm-devise* is intended for use with *Rails 3+* and *Devise 1.2* and above. It may work with earlier versions of devise.

This README only covers *mm-devise* specifics. Make sure to read the [devise README](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/README.rdoc)

## Status update, June 2011

Recently upgraded to (hopefully!) support Devise > 1.2 and MongoMapper 0.9.0. 

## Usage options

The gem gives you the options of 2 ORM setups depending on what library you wish to use for validations:   

* *mongo_mapper* - Uses MongoMapper validations 
* *mongo_mapper_active_model* - Uses ActiveModel::Validations

The advantage to this is ActiveModel's I18n support for error messages, and it uses the same validations lib as devise does by default.

## ActiveModel compatibility 

Currently only the <code>mongo_mapper</code> option has been tested. 
There should be full ActiveModel support in a future version of MongoMapper, after Rails 3 is released.
ActiveModel support will likely be part of *MongoMapper 1.0* (as mentioned by jnunemaker in a post).

## Installation

Add *devise*, *mm-devise* and *MongoMapper* gems to your Gemfile (your Rails app Gemfile). The following gems are required

<pre>  gem 'mongo_mapper',           '>= 0.9.0'
  gem 'jnunemaker-validatable', '>= 1.8.4'
  gem 'devise',                 '>= 1.2'
  gem 'mm-devise',              '>= 1.2'
</pre>

Use bundler to install all required gems in your Rails 3 app 

<pre>bundle install</pre>

Run the generator:

<pre>rails generate devise:install</pre>

The generator will install an initializer which describes ALL Devise's
configuration options and you MUST take a look at it. Make sure to specify
either <code>mongo_mapper</code> or <code>mongo_mapper_active_model</code> (ActiveModel::Validations) 
as the orm in the configuration file.

Note: Is this still required in recent versions of Devise > 1.2 ?

<pre>require 'devise/orm/mongo_mapper'</pre>  

Note: The model generator should do this automatically.

To add Devise to any of your models using the generator:

<pre>rails generate mongo_mapper:devise MODEL</pre>  

Example: create a User model for use with Devise  

<pre>rails generate mongo_mapper:devise User</pre>

## Test Driven Development - extending this project

To develop on this project using TDD, requires the following setup.
Clone this project into a container folder, fx <code>/projects</code>, so you have fx <code>/projects/mm-devise</code>
In the same container folder clone <code>devise</code> from github

Example:

<pre>git clone http://github.com/kristianmandrup/mm-devise.git
git clone http://github.com/plataformatec/devise.git 
cd mm-devise
bundle install
rake test</pre>

## Gem install

<pre>$ rake install</pre>

## Gem release (push to RubyGems)

<pre>$ gem push pkg/mm-devis-xxxx.gem</pre>

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
