A super simple, wafer thin, Solidity contract testing harness.

## Install

```
npm install -g wafr
```

## Usage

```
wafr ./contracts --output ./contracts.json
```

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.4;

import "wafr/Test.sol";

contract MyTest is Test {
  uint firstNumber;
  uint secondNumber;

  function setup() {
    firstNumber = 1;
    secondNumber = 2;
  }

  function test_basicUnitTest() {
    assertTrue(firstNumber != secondNumber, "first should not equal second");
  }

  function test_BasicThrow() {
    if (firstNumber != secondNumber) {
      throw;
    }
  }
}
```

Note, run `npm run example` to see [this example](../../blob/master/example) above in action.

## About

Wafr was created to serve as a very basic testing harness for Solidity contracts. It simply compiles your contracts, then provides a `Test` class that can be inherited to test various contracts.

Wafr acts as a simple testing system. It does very little:

1. Compiles contracts
2. Deployes any contract with `test` in filename that inherits `wafr/Test.sol`
3. Sends ether to your Test contract
4. Runs the `setup` method, if any
5. Runs any method with `test` in the name
6. Then tests everything against the `assert` methods
7. Generates a full report, `--output` your contracts in a `.json` file if desired
