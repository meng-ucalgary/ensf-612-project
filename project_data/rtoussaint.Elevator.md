 * Files to submit
 ******************/

	lab3.jar // An executable jar including all the source files and test cases.
	README	// This file filled with the lab implementation details
	Elevator.input // You can submit a sample input and log file
        Elevator.log   // corresponding to the input but Elevator.log should be 
		       // auto-generated on execution of jar file

/************************
 * Implementation details
 *************************/

/* 
 * This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
 * results. 

 * You are required to provide a good README document including the
 * implementation details. In particular, you can use pseudocode to describe
 * your implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
 * copy/paste your C code. Specifically, explain the synchronization primities
 * used in implmenting the elevator, scheduling choices used, how the capacity
 * constraint is handled, and how the mulitple elevators are supported. Also,
 * explain how to run the test cases for your EventBarrier and Elevator and how
 * to interpret the results. Check the README.OUTPUTFORMAT for the acceptable
 * input/output format for the elevator. Expect the design and implementation
 * details to be at most 2-3 pages.  A plain textfile is encouraged. However, a
 * pdf is acceptable.  No other forms are permitted.

 * In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide the
 * details to maximize your partial credit.
