#skicka

Utility for working with files and folders stored on Google Drive.

Note: skicka is not an official Google product!

##Intro

skicka makes it easy to copy files to and from Google Drive and to work with
files stored on Google Drive.

For example, `skicka upload ~/Pictures /Pictures` copies the entire
contents of the local `~/Pictures` directory to a folder `Pictures` in
Google Drive. If you then run `skicka download /Pictures ~/Pictures2`,
then the contents of your `~/Pictures2` directory will match the contents
of `~/Pictures`.

More generally, skicka makes it easy to list the files in Google Drive
folders, compute the space used by Drive folders, and copy files between
your computer to Google Drive.  If you'd like to encrypt your files before
uploading them, skicka supports AES-256 encryption.

###What skicka is not

skicka is not a general solution for automatically synchronizing files
stored in Google Drive across multiple machines. In particular, it doesn't
have logic to reconcile concurrent changes to the same file on different
machines.

Furthermore, although skicka has been robust in usage so far and has
no known data corruption bugs, it should for now be treated as "alpha"
software.  Bug reports are welcome.

##Getting Started

1. You must have a [Go](http://golang.org) compiler installed.
2. Download and build skicka: `go get github.com/google/skicka`
3. Either copy the `skicka` executable in `$GOPATH/bin` to a directory in
   your `PATH`, or add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`.
4. Configure skicka:
   - Run `skicka init` to create a skeleton `~/.skicka.config` file.
   - Create Google Developer credentials for skicka to use the Google
   Drive API:
       - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
       and select "Create Project".
       - After the project is created, choose "APIs and Auth" from
       the menu on the left, and then choose "Credentials". Select the
       "Create new Client Id" button and choose the "Installed Application"
       type. Select "Other" as the installed application type.
       - Copy the text for "client id" and "client secret" to the
       corresponding entries in your `~/.skicka.config` file.
       - Now, choose "Consent screen" and set the project name
         (e.g. to "skicka", and provide an email address). The specific name and
         email address you choose here doesn't matter; it's only necessary
         that they be set to something.
       - Finally, select "APIs" under "APIs and Auth" and enable the "Drive
       API" for this project.
   - Get an OAuth2 token: run `skicka ls /`; skicka will print a
     URL and ask for a token. Go to the URL in a
     browser, log into your Google account (if needed), and give permission
     for the application to access your Google Drive files. After you
     click 'accept', copy the code from your browser window to the
     terminal with the "Enter verification code" prompt from skicka.
     The verification code is stored in the file `~/.skicka.tokencache.json`
     so that you only need to perform this step once.
   - If you're going store encrypted files in Google Drive, create an
     encryption key: set the environment variable `SKICKA_PASSPHRASE`
     to hold your passphrase and run `skicka genkey`. Copy the lines of
     text that are printed to the `[encryption]` section of your
     `~/.skicka.config` file.
5. Try it out: run `skicka ls -l /`. A list of the files and folders
   in the root directory of your Google Drive should be printed.

##Usage

For a general overview of skicka's commands, run `skicka help`.

To copy a local directory hierarchy to Google Drive, use the `upload`
command.  As the upload progresses, skicka periodically reports how
much data has been uploaded and how much time has elapsed.

```
% skicka upload ~/Pictures /Pictures
11 / 11 [=====================================================] 100.00 % 
skicka: preparation time 1s, sync time 10s
skicka: updated 0 Drive files, 8 local files
skicka: 4.52 MiB read from disk, 0 B written to disk
skicka: 4.52 MiB uploaded (482 kiB/s), 0 B downloaded (0 B/s)
skicka: 32.76 MiB peak memory used
%
```

If you'd like to encrypt the files, create an encryption key as described
above in "Getting Started" and then use the `-encrypt` command-line
option.  skicka looks for your encryption passphrase in the
`SKICKA_PASSPHRASE` environment variable; thus, you might use:

```
% env SKICKA_PASSPHRASE=mySecretPassphrase skicka upload -encrypt ~/Pictures /EncryptedPictures
```

To download a directory hierarchy from Google Drive to your local disk, use
`download`. As the download progresses, status is periodically reported:

```
% skicka download /Pictures/2014 ~/Pictures.copy/2014
10 / 10 [=====================================================] 100.00 % 
skicka: preparation time 1s, sync time 6s
skicka: updated 0 Drive files, 10 local files
skicka: 0 B read from disk, 16.18 MiB written to disk
skicka: 0 B uploaded (0 B/s), 16.18 MiB downloaded (2.33 MiB/s)
skicka: 50.23 MiB peak memory used
%
```

The `ls` command can be used to list files and directories in Google
Drive. For example, after uploading your `~/Pictures` directory, you might
run:

```
% skicka ls /Pictures
2012
2013
2014
```

To see more detail, `ls -l` can be used:

```
% skicka ls -l /Pictures/2013
-rw-r--r--  2.62 MiB  Sun Mar 10 14:41:08 2013  IMG_1127.JPG
-rw-r--r--  2.63 MiB  Sun Mar 10 14:41:09 2013  IMG_1128.JPG
-rw-r--r--  2.32 MiB  Sun Mar 10 14:41:16 2013  IMG_1129.JPG
-rw-r--r--  2.47 MiB  Sun Mar 10 14:43:16 2013  IMG_1130.JPG
[...]
```

In addition to the filename, we see the file size, the file permissions,
and the local modification time that the file on Google Drive is synced
to. The file permissions are based on the permissions of the file when it
was uploaded to Google Drive.

(For even more detail, `ls -ll` can be used, which also prints the MD5
checksums of the files on Google Drive.)

The contents of a single file can be downloaded using `cat`:

```
% skicka cat /Pictures/2013/IMG_1129.JPG > img.jpg
```

Google Drive folders can be created with `mkdir`. (As with the Unix
command, the `-p` option can be specified to indicate that the intermediate
directories in the path should be created).

```
% skicka mkdir /Pictures/2015
```

Finally, the amount of space used by the children of a given Google
Drive folder can be reported by `du`:

```
% skicka du /Pictures
 81.56 MiB  /Pictures/2012
 92.14 MiB  /Pictures/2013
121.02 MiB  /Pictures/2014
294.72 MiB  /Pictures
```

##FAQs

###Can skicka work with Google Drive files that it didn't create itself?

Yes.  The only limitations are that regular Google Drive files don't store
the Unix permissions or the local modification of the original file when it
was uploaded.  Therefore, in this case `skicka download` uses 644
permissions for files it creates and 755 permissions for directories.

###skicka ls -l indicates that a file has world-readable permissions on Google Drive; does this mean anyone can access it?

No.  Those permissions are only used to set the local file permissions when
the file is downloaded with `skicka download`. The access permissions for
the files stored on Drive are handled with Drive's regular mechanisms.

###How can I speed up uploads?

There's a fixed per-file overhead for each file uploaded to Google Drive
that limits skicka to creating roughly five files a second; if files are
relatively small, this overhead will be more of a limit than the time spent
transferring the contents of the files.

If the uploaded files don't need to be accessed individually, creating a
`tar` or `zip` archive of them before uploading may help in this case.

###I occasionally see "operation timed out" or "broken pipe" errors when uploading; what's going on?

A variety of transient errors can happen when using RESTful APIs like the
Google Drive API.  When these errors are encountered, skicka makes a number
of attempts to retry the operation before giving up.

It may be that skicka should make more attempts before giving up or that there are
better error handling strategies; one trade-off is that if there is a
serious error (like the internet connection is lost), then it's useful for
the user to know this sooner rather than later.

If you do see these errors, re-run the operation you were performing; any
files that weren't transferred the first time should be taken care of with
a second run.

###Does skicka support rate-limited uploads and downloads?

Yes. By default, skicka doesn't try to limit its bandwidth usage.  However,
if you add a line `bytes-per-second-limit=...` to the `[upload]` or
`[download]` section of your `.skicka.config` file, you can specify a
maximum number of bytes per second to transfer for uploads or downloads,
respectively.

If this line isn't present (or has a value of zero), then bandwidth won't
be limited.

###Can an http proxy be used with skicka?

Yes--just set the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable appropriately.

###"skicka"?!?

Swedish, "to send".

##Implementation notes

###How files are stored in Google Drive

When a directory hierarchy is uploaded, Google Drive file is created for
each local file and a Google Drive folder is created for each local
directory. skicka stores the time the local copy file was last modified in
the "modifiedDate" Google Drive File resource.  The Unix file permissions
of the file or directory are stored in using a custom "Permissions" file
property, stored as a string with the octal file permissions.

See the discussion of encryption below for details about how encrypted
files are represented.

###Synchronization algorithm

When deciding if a local file needs to be uploaded to Google Drive,
skicka performs the following checks.

1. If there is no corresponding file on Drive, the local file will be uploaded.
2. Otherwise, if there is a corresponding file on Drive and the sizes of the files
are different, the local file will be uploaded.
3. Otherwise, if the local file's modification time is after the modification time of
the file the last time it was synced to Drive, then an MD5 checksum of the
file contents is computed. If this checksum differs from the checksum of
the file stored on Google Drive, the file will be uploaded. (Thus, if
`touch` is run on a file to update its modification time but the
file's contents aren't modified, skicka won't unnecessarily re-upload
the file.)

Note that skicka trusts that file modification times are meaningful: if a
file's contents are modified leaving the file size is unchanged and if the
modification time is set to be in the past, then skicka won't compute an
MD5 checksum and won't know that the file should be uploaded. To override
this behavior, run `skicka upload` with the `-ignore-times` flag; if this
flag is provided, then the MD5 checksum check in the third step will be
applied regardless of the file modification time.

Note also that this algorithm is an algorithm to efficiently mirror the
contents of a set of local files on Google Drive; it's not a general
bidirectional synchronization algorithm.  For example, if a file is
modified both on Drive and on the local filesystem, a `skicka upload` run
will clobber the file contents on Drive. In other words, the assumption is
that the source directory hierarchy is by definition the canonical one and
the destination directory's role is to perfectly reflect the source.

When downloading from Google Drive, skicka follows the same general
approach: only files that don't yet exist, have different sizes, or
different MD5 checksums from the corresponding local file will be
downloaded. The `-ignore-times` option can also be used to bypass the file
modification time check and to force a comparison of file contents to
decide whether to download.

###Encryption

If the `-encrypt` flag is provided to the `upload` command, skicka will
encrypt the contents of each file before uploading it to Google Drive.
Conversely, the `download` and `cat` commands transparently decrypt
encrypted files when downloading them (if the encryption key and passphrase
are available!)

Encryption requires both an encryption key and a passphrase; your
passphrase should be stored in the `SKICKA_PASSPHRASE` environment
variable.  To generate an encryption key, run `skicka genkey`. For example:

```
% env SKICKA_PASSPHRASE=mySecretPassphrase skicka genkey
[...]
```

skicka will generate a few lines of output that are your encrypted
encryption key; to save your key, edit your `~/.skicka.config` file and add
the printed text to the `[encryption]` section of the file.  You can now
upload and encrypt files:

```
% env SKICKA_PASSPHRASE=mySecretPassphrase skicka upload -encrypt ~/backups /backups
```

**If you lose your encryption key or forget your passphrase, your encrypted
data is lost forever.** If you use encryption, please be very careful with
this information.

skicka only encrypts file contents: it doesn't encrypt filenames or hide
file sizes, for example.  If this is problematic for your usage, you should
probably use `tar` or `zip` to put the files you want to encrypt into a
single file before uploading it.

####Key generation and storage

When `skicka genkey` is executed, an encryption key is generated as
follows:

1. skicka generates a random 32-byte salt using Go's
[rand.Reader](http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/), which returns
cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers. The hex-encoded salt is
printed out, and should be recorded in the `salt` field of the
`[encryption]` section of the config file.
2. The user's passphrase, read from the `SKICKA_PASSPHRASE` environment
variable, is run through [the PBKDF2 key derivation
function](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/pbkdf2/pbkdf2.go?repo=crypto),
using 65536 iterations and the SHA-256 hash function to derive a 64-byte
hash.
3. The first 32 bytes of the hash are hex encoded and printed out; they
should be copied to the `passphrase-hash` field of the `[encryption]`
section of the config file. These bytes are later used only to validate
that the user has provided the correct passphrase on subsequent runs of
skicka.
4. A random 32-byte encryption key is generated (again with rand.Reader).
This is the key that will actually be used for encryption and decryption of
file contents.
5. A random 16-byte initialization vector is generated with rand.Reader. It
is hex encoded and printed out, and should be copied to the
`encrypted-key-iv` configuration file field.
6. The encryption key from #4 is encrypted using the initialization vector
from #5, using the second 32 bytes of the hash computed in #2 as the
encryption key.  The result should be copied to the `encrypted-key` field
of the config file.

Upon subsequent runs of skicka, the salt is loaded from the config file
so that PBKDF2 can be used as in #2 above to hash the user's passphrase. If
the first 32 bytes of the passphrase hash match the stored bytes, then the
second 32 bytes of the hash and the stored IV are used to decrypt the
encrypted encryption key.

Given the encryption key, when a file is to be encrypted before being
uploaded to Google Drive, skicka uses the key along with a fresh
16-byte initialization vector for each file to encrypt the file using
AES-256.  The initialization vector is prepended to the file contents
before upload. (Thus, encrypted files are 16 bytes larger on Google Drive
than they are locally.)

The initialization vector is also stored hex-encoded as a Google Drive file
Property with the name "IV". We store the initialization vector redundantly
so that if one downloads the encrypted file contents, it's possible to
decrypt the file using the file contents (and the key!)  alone. Conversely,
also having the IV available in a property makes it possible to encrypt the
contents of a local version of a file without needing to download any of
the contents of the corresponding file from Google Drive.
