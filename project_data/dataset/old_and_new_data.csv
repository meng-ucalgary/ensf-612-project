110,1319,https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/handson-ml,Using pip ,"If you are not using Anaconda, you need to install several scientific Python libraries that are necessary for this project, in particular NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and TensorFlow (and a few others). For this, you can either use Python's integrated packaging system, pip, or you may prefer to use your system's own packaging system (if available, e.g. on Linux, or on MacOSX when using MacPorts or Homebrew). The advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated Python environments with different libraries and different library versions (e.g. one environment for each project). The advantage of using your system's packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your Python libraries and your system's other packages. Since I have many projects with different library requirements, I prefer to use pip with isolated environments.  These are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries. Note: in all the following commands, if you chose to use Python @abstr_number rather than Python @abstr_number , you must replace pip @abstr_number with pip, and python @abstr_number with python.  First you need to make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:       $ pip @abstr_number  install --user --upgrade pip   The --user option will install the latest version of pip only for the current user. If you prefer to install it system wide (i.e. for all users), you must have administrator rights (e.g. use sudo pip @abstr_number instead of pip @abstr_number on Linux), and you should remove the --user option. The same is true of the command below that uses the --user option.  Next, you can optionally create an isolated environment. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially very different libraries, and different versions:       $ pip @abstr_number  install --user --upgrade virtualenv     $ virtualenv -p which python @abstr_number env   This creates a new directory called env in the current directory, containing an isolated Python environment based on Python @abstr_number . If you installed multiple versions of Python @abstr_number on your system, you can replace which python @abstr_number with the path to the Python executable you prefer to use.  Now you must activate this environment. You will need to run this command every time you want to use this environment.       $ source ./env/bin/activate   Next, use pip to install the required python packages. If you are not using virtualenv, you should add the --user option (alternatively you could install the libraries system-wide, but this will probably require administrator rights, e.g. using sudo pip @abstr_number instead of pip @abstr_number on Linux).       $ pip @abstr_number  install --upgrade -r requirements.txt   Great! You're all set, you just need to start Jupyter now.  ","Using pip  If you are not using Anaconda, you need to install several scientific Python libraries that are necessary for this project, in particular NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and TensorFlow (and a few others). For this, you can either use Python's integrated packaging system, pip, or you may prefer to use your system's own packaging system (if available, e.g. on Linux, or on MacOSX when using MacPorts or Homebrew). The advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated Python environments with different libraries and different library versions (e.g. one environment for each project). The advantage of using your system's packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your Python libraries and your system's other packages. Since I have many projects with different library requirements, I prefer to use pip with isolated environments.  These are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries. Note: in all the following commands, if you chose to use Python @abstr_number rather than Python @abstr_number , you must replace pip @abstr_number with pip, and python @abstr_number with python.

This is used during a betting round to determine if that player has placed a bet for the upcoming hand, in which case, would be set to true. * dealer will be null if the hand is in progress as it holds information on what cards are in the dealer's hand.

As the name suggest, the ImmutableRoaringBitmap itself cannot be modified.  This design was inspired by druid.io.  One can find a complete working example in the test file TestMemoryMapping.java.  Note that you should not mix the classes from the org.roaringbitmap package with the classes from the org.roaringbitmap.buffer package. They are incompatible. They serialize to the same output however.  ",3

And it's very good practice to maintain it. (Not a lot of people are using it yet!) :congratulations:  _BTW: I would like to support GitHub Releases in @abstr_hyperlink ;)_  I'm not trying to compare the quality of handwritten and auto-generated logs. That said....  An auto-generated changelog really helps, even if you manually fill in the release notes!  For example:  When I found a closed bug, it's very useful know which release fixed it. In this case, you can easily find the issue by # in CHANGELOG.md.    * it's not quite as easy to find this in handwritten releases notes   * a generated file saves you the trouble of remembering everything; sometimes people forget to add things to a handwritten file    Ultimately, I think GitHub Releases is ideal for end-users. Meanwhile, CHANGELOG.md lives right in the repository, with its detailed list of changes, which is handy for developers. Finally, there's nothing wrong with using GitHub Releases alongside CHANGELOG.md in this combination.    * _I received a warning: ""GitHub API rate limit exceed"" What does this mean?_    GitHub @abstr_hyperlink you can make in an hour. You can make up to @abstr_number , @abstr_number requests per hour. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit is only up to @abstr_number requests per hour. Unauthenticated requests are associated with your IP address (not the user making requests).  If you're seeing this warning, please do the following:  @abstr_number .

","FAQ   _I already use GitHub Releases. Why do I need this?_    GitHub Releases is a very good thing. And it's very good practice to maintain it. (Not a lot of people are using it yet!) :congratulations:  _BTW: I would like to support GitHub Releases in @abstr_hyperlink ;)_  I'm not trying to compare the quality of handwritten and auto-generated logs. That said....  An auto-generated changelog really helps, even if you manually fill in the release notes!  For example:  When I found a closed bug, it's very useful know which release fixed it. In this case, you can easily find the issue by # in CHANGELOG.md.    * it's not quite as easy to find this in handwritten releases notes   * a generated file saves you the trouble of remembering everything; sometimes people forget to add things to a handwritten file    Ultimately, I think GitHub Releases is ideal for end-users. Meanwhile, CHANGELOG.md lives right in the repository, with its detailed list of changes, which is handy for developers. Finally, there's nothing wrong with using GitHub Releases alongside CHANGELOG.md in this combination.    * _I received a warning: ""GitHub API rate limit exceed"" What does this mean?_    GitHub @abstr_hyperlink you can make in an hour. You can make up to @abstr_number , @abstr_number requests per hour. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit is only up to @abstr_number requests per hour.

The patterns have to be @abstr_hyperlink , which in Nim are encoded with a field (usually called kind) which varies in an enum, and a different object layout based on the value of this tag. An example would be  @abstr_code_section  If you have such an algebraic data type, you can do the following with Patty:  @abstr_code_section  This will be translated by the match macro into the following form  @abstr_code_section  Matching by position is also valid, like this:  @abstr_code_section  One can also use _ for a variable, in which case it will not be bound. That is, the following  @abstr_code_section  becomes  @abstr_code_section  Notice that in the examples, the field you dispatch on is called kind, but any other name would do. Also, checks are exhaustive: if you miss a case, the compiler will complain.  One can instead pattern-match on non-variant objects, which essentially amounts to deconstructing fields:  @abstr_code_section  Again, this is the same as  @abstr_code_section  ","1,3"
152,1791,https://github.com/nigredo-tori/patty,Constructing variant objects ,"Patty also provides another macro to create algebraic data types. It looks like  @abstr_code_section  and expands to  @abstr_code_section  Notice that the macro also generates three convenient constructors (Circle ,Rectangle and UnitCircle), and in fact the enum is pure to avoid a name conflict. Also, a proper definition of equality based on the actual contents of the record is generated.  By default the generated ADT is private to the module. If you want to generate a public ADT use the variantp macro, which has the same syntax as variant but makes the types, fields, equality definition and generated constructors public.  A couple of limitations fo the variant macro:    * field names must be unique across branches (that is, different variants cannot have two fields with the same name). This is actually a limitation of Nim.   * the shortcut that groups field names by type does not seem to work, that is, in the above example one could not write Rectangle(w, h: float).    In the future, Patty may also add copy constructors. Also, some work needs to be done to make it easier to use the generated contructors with ref types, in particular for the important case of recursive algebraic data types.

176,2047,https://github.com/mucyomiller/xact,xact is a recipe for handling transactions sensibly in Django applications on PostgreSQL. ,"Note : As of Django @abstr_number . @abstr_number , the functionality of xact will be merged into the Django core as the @abstr_hyperlink . Code that uses xact should be able to be migrated to atomic with just a search-and-replace. atomic works on databases other than PostgreSQL, is thread-safe, and has other nice features; switch to it when you can!  The goals are:    * Database operations that do not modify the database aren't wrapped in a transactions at all.   * Database operations that modify the database are wrapped in a transactions.   * We have a lot of fine-grained control over sections that modify the databse vs those that don't.    The bits of the recipe are:    * Use the @abstr_hyperlink in your database configuration.   * _Do not_ use the @abstr_hyperlink .   * Wrap the sections of code which modify the database in the xact() decorator / context manager below, using it like you would the @abstr_hyperlink decorator.   * Profit!    The quick reasons behind each step:    * Turning on autocommit prevents @abstr_hyperlink from automatically starting a new transaction on the first database operation on each connection; this means that the transaction only starts when we want it to.   * Similarly, the transaction middleware will set the connection state to ""managed,"" which will defeat the autocommit option above, so we leave it out.   * The xact() decorator will set up the connection so that a transaction _is_ started in the relevant block, which is what we want for database-modifying operations.    This recipe a few other nice features:    * xact() operates like commit_on_success(), in that it will issue a rollback if an exception escapes from the block or function it is wrapping.   * xact() ignores the dirty flag on the Django connection. Since we're deliberately wrapping stuff that modifies the database with it, the chance of it being dirty is near @abstr_number %, and a commit on a transaction that did not modify the database is no more expensive in PostgreSQL than a rollback. It also means you can do @abstr_hyperlink inside an xact() block without the @abstr_hyperlink of forgetting to call set_dirty.   * Like the built-in Django transaction decorators, it can be used either as a decorator or as a context manager with the with statement.   * xact() can be nested, giving us nested transactions! If it sees that there is already a transaction open when it starts a new block, it will use a @abstr_hyperlink to set up a nested transaction block. (PostgreSQL does not have nested transactions as such, but you can use savepoints to get @abstr_number . @abstr_number % of the way there.)   * By not wrapping operations that do not modify the database, we get better behavior when using @abstr_hyperlink (more on that in a future post).   * xact() works around an @abstr_hyperlink in Django's transaction handling on psycopg @abstr_number .    xact() also supports the using parameter for @abstr_hyperlink .  Rollback is a supplied exception class designed for situations in which you want to trigger an exception to cause a rollback, but do not want that exception to propagate beyond the scope of the xact block. xact will perform the rollback, then swallow the exception.  Of course, a few caveats:    * xact() requires the postgresql_psycopg @abstr_number backend, and PostgreSQL @abstr_number . @abstr_number or higher. It's possible it can be hacked to work on other backends that support savepoints.   * xact() works just the way you want if it is nested _inside_ a commit_on_success() block (it will properly create a savepoint insted of a new transaction). However, a commit_on_success() block nested inside of xact() will commit or rollback the entire transaction, somewhat defeating the outer xact(). To the extent possible, use only xact() in code you write.   * Be sure you catch exceptions _outside of_ the xact() block; otherwise, the automatic rollback will be defeated. Allow the exception to escape the xact() block, and then catch it. (Of course, if the intention is to always commit and to defeat the rollback, by all means catch the exception inside the block.)    To use, just drop the source (one class definition, one function) into a file somewhere in your Django project (such as the omni-present utils application every Django project seems to have), and include it.  Examples:       from utils.transaction import xact      @xact     def my_view_function @abstr_number (request):        # Everything here will be in a transaction.        # It'll roll back if an exception escapes, commits otherwise.      def my_view_function @abstr_number (request):        # This stuff won't be in a transaction, so don't modify the database here.        with xact():           # This stuff will be, and will commit on normal completion, roll back on a exception      def my_view_function @abstr_number (request):        with xact():           # Modify the database here (let's call it ""part  @abstr_number "").           try:              with xact():                 # Let's call this ""part  @abstr_number .""                 # This stuff will be in its own savepoint, and can commit or                 # roll back without losing the whole transaction.           except:              # Part  @abstr_number  will be rolled back, but part  @abstr_number  will still be available to              # be committed or rolled back.

We need to be careful with return, however, because it's easy to return too early and not execute important parts of the function. For example,  @abstr_code_section  will _always_ return true, even if lightColor is 'red'. Try it!  @abstr_code_section  And that's a great way to cause an accident.  ","if/else if Statements  if statements can also be combined with an else if clause. This is like an else statement, but with its own condition. It will only run if its condition is true, and the previous statement's condition was false.  @abstr_code_section  You can optionally add a final else statement after all of your else if statements. You can probably guess what will happen: if _all of the other statements_ are falsey, this final else block will execute; otherwise, an earlier statement executes and the else block is skipped.  @abstr_code_section    * Define a function ageChecker that takes in an age as a parameter. If the age is between @abstr_number - @abstr_number it should return ""You are a teenager!"". If the age is @abstr_number or below, it should return ""You are a kid"". If the age is above @abstr_number , it should return ""You are a grownup"" Top tip : Remember, if you place a return statement before the end of the function, anything after return won't get executed. We can use this to make code terser:  @abstr_code_section  The above function will return true if lightColor is 'green' — go ahead and try it out.  @abstr_code_section  And false otherwise:  @abstr_code_section  Notice that we didn't have to use an else statement; we can just depend on return.  We need to be careful with return, however, because it's easy to return too early and not execute important parts of the function. For example,  @abstr_code_section  will _always_ return true, even if lightColor is 'red'. Try it!  @abstr_code_section  And that's a great way to cause an accident.  ",3

201,2254,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,Intro ,"YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for @abstr_hyperlink . It has several completion engines:    * an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based engine that provides native semantic code completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ (from now on referred to as ""the C-family languages""),   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for Python @abstr_number and @abstr_number (using the @abstr_hyperlink wrapper),   * an @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for C#,   * a combination of @abstr_hyperlink and @abstr_hyperlink semantic engines for Go,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for TypeScript,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for JavaScript,   * a @abstr_hyperlink -based completion engine for Rust,   * and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).    @abstr_image  Here's an explanation of what happens in the short GIF demo above.  First, realize that no keyboard shortcuts had to be pressed to get the list of completion candidates at any point in the demo. The user just types and the suggestions pop up by themselves. If the user doesn't find the completion suggestions relevant and/or just wants to type, they can do so; the completion engine will not interfere.  When the user sees a useful completion string being offered, they press the TAB key to accept it. This inserts the completion string. Repeated presses of the TAB key cycle through the offered completions.  If the offered completions are not relevant enough, the user can continue typing to further filter out unwanted completions.  A critical thing to notice is that the completion filtering is NOT based on the input being a string prefix of the completion (but that works too). The input needs to be a _ @abstr_hyperlink match_ of a completion. This is a fancy way of saying that any input characters need to be present in a completion string in the order in which they appear in the input. So abc is a subsequence of xaybgc, but not of xbyxaxxc. After the filter, a complicated sorting system ranks the completion strings so that the most relevant ones rise to the top of the menu (so you usually need to press TAB just once).  All of the above works with any programming language because of the identifier-based completion engine. It collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).  The demo also shows the semantic engine in use. When the user presses ., -> or :: while typing in insert mode (for C++; different triggers are used for other languages), the semantic engine is triggered (it can also be triggered with a keyboard shortcut; see the rest of the docs).  The last thing that you can see in the demo is YCM's diagnostic display features (the little red X that shows up in the left gutter; inspired by @abstr_hyperlink ) if you are editing a C-family file. As Clang compiles your file and detects warnings or errors, they will be presented in various ways. You don't need to save your file or press any keyboard shortcut to trigger this, it ""just happens"" in the background.  In essence, YCM obsoletes the following Vim plugins because it has all of their features plus extra:    * clang_complete   * AutoComplPop   * Supertab   * neocomplcache    And that's not all...  YCM also provides semantic IDE-like features in a number of languages, including:    * finding declarations, definitions, usages, etc. of identifiers,   * displaying type information for classes, variables, functions etc.,   * displaying documentation for methods, members, etc. in the preview window,   * fixing common coding errors, like missing semi-colons, typos, etc.,   * semantic renaming of variables across files (JavaScript only).    Features vary by file type, so make sure to check out the file type feature summary and the full list of completer subcommands to find out what's available for your favourite languages.  You'll also find that YCM has filepath completers (try typing ./ in a file) and a completer that integrates with @abstr_hyperlink .

Ensure that your version of Vim is _at least_ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number _and_ that it has support for Python @abstr_number or Python @abstr_number scripting.       Inside Vim, type :version. Look at the first two to three lines of output;     it should say Vi IMproved X.Y, where X.Y is the major version of vim. If     your version is greater than  @abstr_number . @abstr_number , then you're all set. If your version is      @abstr_number . @abstr_number  then look below that where it says, Included patches:  @abstr_number -Z, where Z     will be some number. That number needs to be  @abstr_number  or higher.      If your version of Vim is not recent enough, you may need to [compile Vim     from source][vim-build] (don't worry, it's easy).      After you have made sure that you have Vim  @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number +, type the following in     Vim: :echo has('python') || has('python @abstr_number '). The output should be  @abstr_number . If     it's  @abstr_number , then get a version of Vim with Python support.      On Windows, check also if your Vim architecture is  @abstr_number  or  @abstr_number -bit. This is     critical because it must match the Python and the YCM libraries     architectures. We recommend using a  @abstr_number -bit Vim.   @abstr_number . Install YCM with @abstr_hyperlink (or @abstr_hyperlink , but Vundle is a better idea). With Vundle, this would mean adding a Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe' line to your @abstr_hyperlink .       If you don't install YCM with Vundle, make sure you have run     git submodule update --init --recursive after checking out the YCM     repository (Vundle will do this for you) to fetch YCM's dependencies.   @abstr_number . [Complete this step ONLY if you care about semantic completion support for C-family languages. Otherwise it's not necessary.]       Download the latest version of libclang. Clang is an open-source     compiler that can compile C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++. The libclang     library it provides is used to power the YCM semantic completion engine for     those languages. YCM is designed to work with libclang version  @abstr_number . @abstr_number  or     higher, but can in theory work with any  @abstr_number . @abstr_number + version as well.      You can use the system libclang _only if you are sure it is version  @abstr_number . @abstr_number  or     higher_, otherwise don't. Even if it is, we recommend using the [official     binaries from llvm.org][clang-download] if at all possible. Make sure you     download the correct archive file for your OS.      We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system libclang instead of     the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself the     hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.   @abstr_number . Compile theycm_core library that YCM needs. This library is the C++ engine that YCM uses to get fast completions.       You will need to have cmake installed in order to generate the required     makefiles. Linux users can install cmake with their package manager (sudo     apt-get install cmake for Ubuntu) whereas other users can [download and     install][cmake-download] cmake from its project site. Mac users can also get     it through [Homebrew][brew] with brew install cmake.      On a Unix OS, you need to make sure you have Python headers installed. On a     Debian-like Linux distro, this would be sudo apt-get install python-dev     python @abstr_number -dev. On Mac they should already be present.      On Windows, you need to download and install [Python  @abstr_number  or     Python  @abstr_number ][python-win-download]. Pick the version corresponding to your Vim     architecture. You will also need Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) to build YCM.     You can obtain it by installing [Visual Studio][visual-studio-download].     MSVC  @abstr_number  (Visual Studio  @abstr_number ),  @abstr_number  ( @abstr_number ), and  @abstr_number  ( @abstr_number ) are officially     supported.      Here we'll assume you installed YCM with Vundle. That means that the     top-level YCM directory is in ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe.      We'll create a new folder where build files will be placed. Run the     following:          cd ~         mkdir ycm_build         cd ycm_build      Now we need to generate the makefiles. If you DON'T care about semantic     support for C-family languages, run the following command in the ycm_build     directory:          cmake -G """" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp      where <generator> is Unix Makefiles on Unix systems and one of the     following Visual Studio generators on Windows:      - Visual Studio  @abstr_number  Win @abstr_number     - Visual Studio  @abstr_number  Win @abstr_number     - Visual Studio  @abstr_number  Win @abstr_number      Remove the Win @abstr_number part in these generators if your Vim architecture is      @abstr_number -bit.      For those who want to use the system version of boost, you would pass     -DUSE_SYSTEM_BOOST=ON to cmake. This may be necessary on some systems     where the bundled version of boost doesn't compile out of the box.      NOTE: We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system boost instead     of the bundled version of boost. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the bundled version of boost.      If you DO care about semantic support for C-family languages, then your     cmake call will be a bit more complicated.  We'll assume you downloaded a     binary distribution of LLVM+Clang from llvm.org in step  @abstr_number  and that you     extracted the archive file to folder ~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir (with bin,     lib, include etc. folders right inside that folder). On Windows, you can     extract the files from the LLVM+Clang installer using [ @abstr_number -zip][ @abstr_number z-download].      NOTE: This _only_ works with a _downloaded_ LLVM binary package, not a     custom-built LLVM! See docs below for EXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH when using a     custom LLVM build.      With that in mind, run the following command in the ycm_build directory:          cmake -G """" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp      where <generator> is replaced like above.      Now that configuration files have been generated, compile the libraries     using this command:          cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release      The --config Release part is specific to Windows and will be ignored on a     Unix OS.      For those who want to use the system version of libclang, you would pass     -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBCLANG=ON to cmake _instead of_ the     -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=... flag.      NOTE: We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system libclang instead     of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.      You could also force the use of a custom libclang library with     -DEXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so flag (the library would end     with .dylib on a Mac). Again, this flag would be used _instead of_ the     other flags. If you compiled LLVM from source, this is the flag you should     be using.      Running the cmake command will also place the libclang.[so|dylib|dll] in     the YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd folder for you if you compiled with     clang support (it needs to be there for YCM to work).   @abstr_number . Set up support for additional languages, as desired:    * C# support: Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/OmniSharpServer and run msbuild (Windows) or xbuild (other platforms, using mono) depending on your platform. If mono is not installed, install it. When on Windows, be sure that @abstr_hyperlink .    * Go support: If go is not installed on your system, install it and add it to your path. Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/gocode and run go build.    * TypeScript support: As with the quick installation, simply npm install -g typescript after successfully installing @abstr_hyperlink .    * JavaScript support: Install @abstr_hyperlink . Then navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime and run npm install --production    * Rust support: Install @abstr_hyperlink .

Now that configuration files have been generated, compile the libraries     using this command:          cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release      The --config Release part is specific to Windows and will be ignored on a     Unix OS.      For those who want to use the system version of libclang, you would pass     -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBCLANG=ON to cmake _instead of_ the     -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=... flag.      NOTE: We STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use of the system libclang instead     of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.      You could also force the use of a custom libclang library with     -DEXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so flag (the library would end     with .dylib on a Mac). Again, this flag would be used _instead of_ the     other flags. If you compiled LLVM from source, this is the flag you should     be using.      Running the cmake command will also place the libclang.[so|dylib|dll] in     the YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd folder for you if you compiled with     clang support (it needs to be there for YCM to work).   @abstr_number . Set up support for additional languages, as desired:    * C# support: Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/OmniSharpServer and run msbuild (Windows) or xbuild (other platforms, using mono) depending on your platform. If mono is not installed, install it. When on Windows, be sure that @abstr_hyperlink .    * Go support: If go is not installed on your system, install it and add it to your path. Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/gocode and run go build.    * TypeScript support: As with the quick installation, simply npm install -g typescript after successfully installing @abstr_hyperlink .    * JavaScript support: Install @abstr_hyperlink . Then navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime and run npm install --production    * Rust support: Install @abstr_hyperlink . Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/racerd and run cargo build --release.     That's it. You're done. Refer to the _User Guide_ section on how to use YCM. Don't forget that if you want the C-family semantic completion engine to work, you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to YCM. It's all in the User Guide.  YCM comes with sane defaults for its options, but you still may want to take a look at what's available for configuration. There are a few interesting options that are conservatively turned off by default that you may want to turn on.  ",3

YCM has several completion engines: an identifier-based completer that collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).  There are also several semantic engines in YCM. There's a libclang-based completer that provides semantic completion for C-family languages. There's a Jedi-based completer for semantic completion for Python. There's also an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions when no native completer exists for that language in YCM.  There are also other completion engines, like the UltiSnips completer and the filepath completer.  YCM automatically detects which completion engine would be the best in any situation.

201,2287,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,Diagnostic Display ,"YCM will display diagnostic notifications for C-family and C# languages if you compiled YCM with Clang and Omnisharp support, respectively. Since YCM continuously recompiles your file as you type, you'll get notified of errors and warnings in your file as fast as possible.  Here are the various pieces of the diagnostic UI:    * Icons show up in the Vim gutter on lines that have a diagnostic.   * Regions of text related to diagnostics are highlighted (by default, a red wavy underline in gvim and a red background in vim).   * Moving the cursor to a line with a diagnostic echoes the diagnostic text.   * Vim's location list is automatically populated with diagnostic data (off by default, see options).    The new diagnostics (if any) will be displayed the next time you press any key on the keyboard. So if you stop typing and just wait for the new diagnostics to come in, that _will not work_. You need to press some key for the GUI to update.  Having to press a key to get the updates is unfortunate, but cannot be changed due to the way Vim internals operate; there is no way that a background task can update Vim's GUI after it has finished running. You _have to_ press a key. This will make YCM check for any pending diagnostics updates.  You _can_ force a full, blocking compilation cycle with the :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics command (you may want to map that command to a key; try putting nnoremap <F @abstr_number > :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics<CR> in your vimrc). Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI _will_ be blocked.  YCM will display a short diagnostic message when you move your cursor to the line with the error. You can get a detailed diagnostic message with the <leader>d key mapping (can be changed in the options) YCM provides when your cursor is on the line with the diagnostic.  You can also see the full diagnostic message for all the diagnostics in the current file in Vim's locationlist, which can be opened with the :lopen and :lclose commands (make sure you have set let g:ycm_always_populate_location_list = @abstr_number in your vimrc).

Additionally it implements a composition mechanism to create new applications from previously implemented modules and to make them cooperating with modules running on top of the operator’s controller (represented by the Server Controller in the Figure), effectively building a single Network Application.  The Network Engine follows the layered SDN controller approach proposed by the Open Networking Foundation. It comprises a client controller layer that executes the modules network applications are composed of and a server SDN controller layer that drives the underlying infrastructure.  The challenge is to integrate client and server controllers. To maximize reuse, we use separate adaptors for the Southbound Interface (SBI), called Backend, and for the Northbound Interface (NBI), called Shim. This separation imposes a protocol between them, the NetIDE Intermediate Protocol (see the full protocol specification in libraries/netip/docs). In our first implementations [ @abstr_number ] we have proved that the Shim/Backend structure connected by an intermediate protocol is feasible and sensible. However, they still left the fundamental component in these modules: the composition logic. This implied that it needed to be reimplemented for each controller framework we wanted to support. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an intermediate layer, the Core: it hosts all logic and data structures that are independent of the particular controller frameworks and communicates with both Shim and Backend using the same NetIDE Intermediate Protocol. The Core makes both Shim and Backend light-weight and easier to implement for new controllers.

If you would like to contribute code, here is the procedure:  @abstr_number . Fork this repo. @abstr_number . Make sure what you want to contribute is already listed as an open issue in our issue tracker. If it is not, post it as an issue first and wait for it to get accepted (an issue is considered 'accepted' when it is assigned a priority.* label). @abstr_number . You may choose an issue labeled forFirstTimers as your first issue, if there are any. But do not do more than one forFirstTimers issues. @abstr_number . Clone your fork onto your Computer. @abstr_number . Create a branch. The branch name should be in the format issue-number-some-key-words i.e. issue number followed by @abstr_number - @abstr_number key words related to the issue description e.g. @abstr_number -broken-link-week @abstr_number -schedule @abstr_number . Implement your fix in the new branch. * Use @abstr_number spaces for indenting (not tab, not @abstr_number or @abstr_number spaces) * Minimize inline styles. * When in doubt, you can refer to these style guides from the TEAMMATES project: @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink , @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number . Test the code in your computer. Tip: When testing local html files, some JavaScripts might not work in Firefox or Chrome. In that case you can use IE. Alternatively, you can @abstr_hyperlink @abstr_number . When the fix is ready, @abstr_number . Ensure that your fork has the latest code from this repo (the repo you forked from is called the 'upstreamrepo). The code in the upstream repo may have been updated while you were fixing the issue. If that is the case, [sync your fork with upstream repo](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) @abstr_number . Stage your changes:<br> Your reviewer might want to see how your changes look like to a viewer of the website. To create a [*staging site*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_site) using [*GitHub Pages* feature](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/), create a branch calledgh-pages, merge your branch to thegh-pagesbranch and push thegh-pagesbranch to your fork. A running version of the website should now be available from the correspondinggithub.ioURL. Here is an example [http://bobby-lin.github.io/website/](http://bobby-lin.github.io/website/). @abstr_number . Push the code to your fork and create a pull request (PR) against the master branch of this repo.<br> When naming the PR, copy paste the name of the issue you are fixing, including the original issue number.<br> e.g.Handbook TOC links are not working in iPhone browser # @abstr_number <br> In the PR description, mentionFixes #IssueNumber(e.g.Fixes # @abstr_number so that the corresponding issue is closed automatically when the PR is merged.<br> Remember to mention the URL of the staging site in your PR description. [Here](https://github.com/nus-cs @abstr_number /website/pull/ @abstr_number ) is an example. @abstr_number . Check the diff view of the PR to ensure it contains the intended changes only. @abstr_number . Your code will be reviewed by someone from the dev team. If the reviewer requests changes, revise the code, push the new commits to your branch, and post a comment to say the pull request is ready for review again. @abstr_number . When your code is acceptable, it will be merged to this repo. Your fix will be included in the next release of the website. @abstr_number . After your fix is merged, you may wish to create another PR to add your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. There is no need to create a corresponding issue for that PR.  ",7

258,2915,https://github.com/omedbb/volume-leather-fill,The Code ,"First off, the best thing about the code is that it's pretty well documented. Most methods have the Apple-style documentation, which means that you can triple-click on the method name to get its documentation.  The code started to resemble the structure of the original @abstr_number . So for example, it has a game manager, a board class, a tile class, etc. I at least _tried_ to stick to MVC as much as possible. Here is a brief summary to get you started:    * The M @abstr_number GameManager class controls the game logic. There is only one action in the game: move. So the majority of that class is handling the move. The rest is checking whether you've won or died, etc.   * The M @abstr_number Grid class is the data structure for the board. The original @abstr_number used a @abstr_number -D array, but heck, @abstr_number -D array doesn't seem to be too bad here! ...except looping it is a bit ugly, so I made a forEach helper function.   * The M @abstr_number Cell class is the ""slot""s. They are not the tiles themselves. The benefit of having this class is that the cells never move, so they are good references and they don't mess stuff up.   * The M @abstr_number Tile class is the actual tile, and this is the actual SpriteKit class. If all you want is some sample code for SpriteKit, here it is. I believe my animations are smoother than the other @abstr_number on the App Store, and are closer to the original animation.   * The M @abstr_number GlobalState class is a global class accessible from anywhere in the universe. Well, global stuff is evil, right? At least so we are told. But, it is at least better to encapsulate the global stuff into one single object (namespace), and that's a singleton right there.   * The M @abstr_number Theme class and its subclasses control the theme.   * There are also some controller classes and view classes. It's probably a better idea to do the Game Over scene in SpriteKit, but I was lazy so I faked it using a view. The M @abstr_number GridView class is the one that draws the board, btw.

The class Raven_Contoller depends on class Raven_PathPlanner to compute and design circular trajectories. So, it is basically where all the math is! In the class Raven_Controller, there are two Raven_PathPlanner objects managing the motion of LEFT and RIGHT arm of RAVEN. (All these files belong to the talkerAutoCircle ROS node.)

Note that only the ones specified as (original) are the original files created here, others are copied from the main RAVEN software and do NOT need to copy again to the main RAVEN software when combining.  /msg folder:  ---- raven_automove.msg  ---- raven_state.msg /src folder:  ---- /raven_ @abstr_number folder:  -------- raven_automove.h  -------- raven_state.h  ---- DS @abstr_number .h  ---- DS @abstr_number .h  ---- Raven_Controller.cpp --------------------- (original)  ---- Raven_Controller.h ----------------------- (original)This class controls the threads and workflow.  ---- Raven_PathPlanner.cpp -------------------- (original)  ---- Raven_PathPlanner.h ---------------------- (original)This class defines all the math and path planning.  ---- listener.cpp ----------------------------- (original)This will be replaced with main RAVEN software.  ---- talker.cpp ------------------------------- (original)This file is where main is.  ---- tools.h AutoCircle Generator flowchart.png ----------- (original)The ROS publish/subscribe flowchart for better understanding.  CMakeLists.txt ------------------------------- (original)Should merge with CMakeLists.txt in main RAVEN software.  README.md ------------------------------------ (original)This file!  package.xml ---------------------------------- (original)The ROS package.xml file.  The file talker.cpp is the heart of AutoCircle generater, it is where the main is. This file uses on methods defined in class Raven_Controller. Inside of class Raven_Contoller, there are two threads - ros_thread and console_thread, which takes charge of the ROS publishing/subscribing issues and user console inputs respectively. The class Raven_Contoller depends on class Raven_PathPlanner to compute and design circular trajectories. So, it is basically where all the math is! In the class Raven_Controller, there are two Raven_PathPlanner objects managing the motion of LEFT and RIGHT arm of RAVEN. (All these files belong to the talkerAutoCircle ROS node.) And since we are NOT actually connected to the main RAVEN software yet, we have listener.cpp as the simplified version to simulate the main RAVEN software just so talker.cpp has someone to interact with. Thus, listener.cpp will be completely replaced when we actually combine it with the RAVEN code. (This file belongs to the listenerAutoCircle ROS node.)  ",6
264,2970,https://github.com/melodysu83/AutoCircle_generater,How To Use This Code: ,"This software design allows RAVEN to be controlled and follow predefined circular trajectory from any remote computer, so below is the instruction for hardware setup and terminal commands for it to work. Computer A: The computer that downloads this AutoCircle_generater software and runsroscore from here. Computer B: This is the computer that RAVEN main software runs on. (This should be already setup and ready to go.)  @abstr_number . Find out hostname and IP : On both computer A and computer B, open up a terminal, type in ""hostname"" to find out the hostname of that computer and type in ""ifconfig"" to find out the IP address. Note that it will be better and more stable connection-wise if both computers are connected to wired internet. Because wireless connections does not have static IP, and can cause floating IP problem which may cause us to lose connection midway through your control. Up to this point, we should have: IP for computer A and B (denoted as IP_A and IP_B later on in the instruction),as well as the hostname for computer A and B (denoted as hostname_A and hostname_B later on in the instruction).  @abstr_number . Download AutoCircle_generater code : On computer A, type in ""git clone git://github.com/melodysu @abstr_number /AutoCircle_generater.git"" to download this repository to the directory you desire. It should create a AutoCircle_generater folder under that directory. Note that this should be a directory under the your ROS workspace. Then go back to your ROS workspace directory, type in ""catkin_make_isolated --pkg AutoCircle_generater"", and this should build the software. Now this part of the software is done.  @abstr_number . ssh : On computer A, open up another terminal and type in ""ssh -X hostname_A@IP_B"", it should allow you to control computer B from this terminal. Assume you already have RAVEN running on this computer, type in ""pwd"", and then ""roscd raven_ @abstr_number "". Note that this RAVEN code should be the RAVEN @abstr_number . @abstr_number release version in October @abstr_number , because there is a pedal down/pedal up switch where you can control by pressing 'd' and 'u' keys respectively. And this feature is required for the AutoCircle_generater to work. If you don't have the version yet, you can download it from @abstr_hyperlink , and use the indigo branch.  @abstr_number . Up and running : On computer A, open up another terminal and run ""roscore"". Use ths terminal is step @abstr_number , type in ""sudo roslaunch raven_ @abstr_number raven_ @abstr_number .launch"". Next, initialize RAVEN. After it is initialized, press 'd' and it holds the pedal down state for @abstr_number seconds. If no commend is sent within the time range, it will automatically switch back to pedal up state. If you are constantantly sending commends, then RAVEN will be in pedal down state all the time until you press 'u' manually. But you can always re-press 'd' again if you need to. Within the @abstr_number second, use the terminal in step @abstr_number , type in ""rosrun AutoCircle_genetater talkerAutoCircle"" under the main ROS workspace directory, and you sill need to press ""Enter"" to start.

264,2971,https://github.com/melodysu83/AutoCircle_generater,Trouble Shooting : ,"These are the problems that may occur to you. Basically if you are running AutoCircle_generater code, and still the pedal down state in RAVEN holds for @abstr_number seconds then jumps back to pedal up, that means there is something wrong with the connection.

If not, try ""ping IP_A"". If hostname_A fails but IP_A works, that means computer B does not know the name of computer A. Do it by typing in ""gedit /etc/hosts"" and add in hostname_A IP_A to the list of hosts. If even ""ping IP_A"" does not work, then there is some internet issue, try checking your internet connection and double check the IP address. Do the same process for computer A on any other terminal, only to change by typing ""ping hostname_B"" and ""ping IP_B"". If both sides are working good,  @abstr_number .

There are, of course, a number of software packages out there already that will read these files, including the ones from Vision Research, other tools from @abstr_hyperlink , and others, but I was unable to find an open-source/free-software one, so... here is this (though note the See Also; I've since discovered other projects doing similar things).

For example, for MS COCO we can run the prepro file as follows:  @abstr_code_section  This is telling the script to read in all the data (the images and the captions), allocate @abstr_number images for val/test splits respectively, and map all words that occur <= @abstr_number times to a special UNK token. The resulting json and h @abstr_number files are about @abstr_number GB and contain everything we want to know about the dataset.  Warning : the prepro script will fail with the default MSCOCO data because one of their images is corrupted. See @abstr_hyperlink for the fix, it involves manually replacing one image in the dataset.  The last thing we need is the @abstr_hyperlink , (under Models section, "" @abstr_number -layer model"" bullet point). Put the two files (the prototxt configuration file and the proto binary of weights) somewhere (e.g. a model directory), and we're ready to train!  @abstr_code_section  The train script will take over, and start dumping checkpoints into the folder specified by checkpoint_path (default = current folder). You also have to point the train script to the VGGNet protos (see the options inside train.lua).  If you'd like to evaluate BLEU/METEOR/CIDEr scores during training in addition to validation cross entropy loss, use -language_eval @abstr_number option, but don't forget to download the @abstr_hyperlink into coco-caption directory.  A few notes on training. To give you an idea, with the default settings one epoch of MS COCO images is about @abstr_number iterations. @abstr_number epoch of training (with no finetuning - notice this is the default) takes about @abstr_number hour and results in validation loss ~ @abstr_number . @abstr_number and CIDEr score of ~ @abstr_number . @abstr_number . By iteration @abstr_number , @abstr_number CIDEr climbs up to about @abstr_number . @abstr_number (validation loss at about @abstr_number . @abstr_number ) and then will top out at a bit below @abstr_number . @abstr_number CIDEr. After that additional improvements are only possible by turning on CNN finetuning. I like to do the training in stages, where I first train with no finetuning, and then restart the train script with -finetune_cnn_after @abstr_number to start finetuning right away, and using -start_from flag to continue from the previous model checkpoint. You'll see your score rise up to about @abstr_number . @abstr_number CIDEr over ~ @abstr_number days or so (on MS COCO).

As we learned, this level of application authentication is important in that it allows the API provider to ensure good behavior by any client application.  Application-level authentication like this gives us access to application-level functions, for instance, venue search. This is an application-level function because you don't need to be any particular user to search for a coffee shop. In fact, if we look at the @abstr_hyperlink API documentation, we see an entry: Requires Acting User: No at the top.  Compare that to the documentation for @abstr_hyperlink , and we see that this function does require an acting user, which makes sense, because the application doesn't have friends, an individual user does.  So, if we want to show our user what their friends are doing, we need a way of authenticating the user to Foursquare through our application.  It's not enough for a user to be logged in to Foursquare and use our app, because Foursquare needs to know that we are acting on _behalf_ of a user and that the user has _allowed_ that action.  We could write some code to log in on behalf of the user, but that would require us to ask the user for their Foursquare login credentials. Think about that as if you're the user. Are you going to give some random website your login and password for Foursquare? The very thought should make you very suspicious of our motives.  @abstr_image  Beyond the security issues, there's the problem of keeping things up to date. If we ask the user to log in to Foursquare on every request, that's a horrible experience.  However, if we store the user's Foursquare login info, we have whole other problems.  The first is that we'd have to store them unencrypted, in plain text, because Fourquare expects a person to log in with their unencrypted credentials. So we have another security problem. Now we have a database full of unencrypted Foursquare credentials waiting for anyone to get in there and grab them all.  Beyond the security issue is a logistical one. If the user changes her password on Foursquare, we'll never know about it, and our app will break.

Update your @abstr_hyperlink and add a Redirect URI. Let's set it to http://localhost: @abstr_number /auth and save the app.  Because we're going to be using our client ID/secret a lot, instead of always typing it in, let's use a .env @abstr_hyperlink to hold our FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID and FOURSQUARE_SECRET values. Once that's set up, we'll be able to access these values as ENV['FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID'] and ENV['FOURSQUARE_SECRET'], which is much easier to keep track of. Follow the instructions to set up Dotenv and add your app's client ID and secret. Don't forget to restart your server after you change any values in .env!

This will route that redirect to our SessionsController and a create action, which is where we'll get the token. So now let's implement that.  ",3

","Transfer Learning Lab with VGG, Inception and ResNet  @abstr_hyperlink  In this lab, you will continue exploring transfer learning. You've already explored feature extraction with AlexNet and TensorFlow. Next, you will use Keras to explore feature extraction with the VGG, Inception and ResNet architectures. The models you will use were trained for days or weeks on the @abstr_hyperlink . Thus, the weights encapsulate higher-level features learned from training on thousands of classes.  We'll use two datasets in this lab:  @abstr_number . German Traffic Sign Dataset @abstr_number . Cifar @abstr_number  Unless you have a powerful GPU, running feature extraction on these models will take a significant amount of time. To make things we precomputed bottleneck features for each (network, dataset) pair, this will allow you experiment with feature extraction even on a modest CPU. You can think of bottleneck features as feature extraction but with caching. Because the base network weights are frozen during feature extraction, the output for an image will always be the same. Thus, once the image has already been passed once through the network we can cache and reuse the output.  The files are encoded as such:    * {network}_{dataset}_bottleneck_features_train.p   * {network}_{dataset}_bottleneck_features_validation.p    network can be one of 'vgg', 'inception', or 'resnet'  dataset can be on of 'cifar @abstr_number ' or 'traffic'  How will the pretrained model perform on the new datasets?

Any module may be excluded except for core, and selector. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the src folder (without the .js extension).  Some example modules that can be excluded are:    * ajax : All AJAX functionality: $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.ajaxSetup(), .load(), transports, and ajax event shorthands such as .ajaxStart().   * ajax/xhr : The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.   * ajax/script : The <script> AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.   * ajax/jsonp : The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.   * css : The .css() method.

294,3384,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,"Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.) ","Generally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a .Button CSS class in <AcceptButton> and <RejectButton> components, we recommend creating a <Button> component with its own .Button styles, that both <AcceptButton> and <RejectButton> can render (but @abstr_hyperlink ).  Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.  First, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:  @abstr_code_section  Then in package.json, add the following lines to scripts:  @abstr_code_section  > Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace build-css and watch-css commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.  Now you can rename src/App.css to src/App.scss and run npm run watch-css. The watcher will find every Sass file in src subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting src/App.css. Since src/App.js still imports src/App.css, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit src/App.scss, and src/App.css will be regenerated.  To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, src/App.scss and other component style files could include @import ""./shared.scss""; with variable definitions.  At this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add src/**/*.css to your .gitignore file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.  As a final step, you may find it convenient to run watch-css automatically with npm start, and run build-css as a part of npm run build. You can use the && operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:  @abstr_code_section  Then we can change start and build scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:  @abstr_code_section  Now running npm start and npm run build also builds Sass files.

294,3416,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,Testing Components ,"There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.  Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:  @abstr_code_section  This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in src/App.test.js.  When you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.  If you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using @abstr_hyperlink from @abstr_hyperlink . You can write a smoke test with it too:  @abstr_code_section  @abstr_code_section  Unlike the previous smoke test using ReactDOM.render(), this test only renders <App> and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if <App> itself renders a <Button> that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports @abstr_hyperlink , and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.  You can read the @abstr_hyperlink for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in expect() and jest.fn() for spies.

It builds upon the strengths of Java, but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk. Groovy makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve as well as supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain. Groovy makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL. It also increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications. Groovy simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box. Groovy also seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java.  ","1,1"

312,3598,https://github.com/jbakic/Shielded,Shielded ,"Available on @abstr_hyperlink .  Shielded is a full-featured implementation of Software Transactional Memory in .NET. It provides a system (the Shield static class) for running in-memory transactions, and data structures which are aware of transactions. It can also generate transaction-aware proxy subclasses based on a POCO class type. The implementation is strict, with strong guarantees on safety. It is mostly lock-free, using only one major lock which is held during the pre-commit check.  Here is a small example:  @abstr_code_section  Shielded fields are thread-safe. You can read them out of transaction, but changes must be done inside. While inside, the library guarantees a consistent view of all shielded fields.  Another example, the STM version of ""Hello world!"" - parallel addition in an array. Here, in a dictionary:  @abstr_code_section  Shielded works with value types, and the language automatically does the needed cloning. For ref types, it only makes the reference itself transactional. The class should then be immutable, or, if you have a class you want to make transactional:  @abstr_code_section  Then you create instances like this:  @abstr_code_section  The Factory creates a proxy sub-class, using CodeDom, which will have transactional overrides for all virtual properties of the base class that are public or protected. Due to CodeDom limitations, the getter and setter must have the same accessibility! The proxy objects are thread-safe (or, at least their virtual properties are), and can only be changed inside transactions. Usage is simple:  @abstr_code_section  It is safe to execute any number of concurrent transactions that are reading from or writing into the same shielded fields - each transaction will complete correctly. This is accomplished by: * ensuring that in one transaction you read a consistent state of all shielded fields * buffering writes into storage which is local for each thread  Your changes are commited and made visible to other threads only if all the shielded fields you read or wrote into have not changed since you started. If any have new changes, your transaction is retried from the beginning, but this time reading the new data. Though it may seem so, this cannot create an infinite loop since for any conflict to occur at least one transaction must successfully commit. Overall, the system must make progress.  This quality would place Shielded in the lock-free class of non-blocking concurrency mechanisms, according to academic classification. However, this is not accurate since the commit check gets done under a lock. Hence the word ""mostly"" in the short description.  ","Shielded  Available on @abstr_hyperlink .

312,3599,https://github.com/jbakic/Shielded,Features ," MVCC : Each transaction reads a consistent snapshot of the state without the need for locking, since updates just create new versions.     * Old versions are dropped soon after no one is capable of reading them any more.   * Read-only transactions always complete without any repetitions and without entering the global lock!   * Strictness : If a write is made anywhere, the system will insist that all touched locations, read or written, still contain the same version of data that they had when the transaction opened. This means it does not suffer from the Write Skew issue.   * Transactional collections : Included in the library are ShieldedDict<> (dictionary), ShieldedSeq<> (singly linked list) and ShieldedTree<> (a red-black tree implementation).     * It is possible to use this library with immutable collections from @abstr_hyperlink .   * Transaction-local storage : ShieldedLocal<> allows storing anything in the transaction context, visible only from within that transaction.   * To perform side-effects (IO, and most other operations which are not shielded) you use the SideEffect method of the Shield class, which takes optional onCommit and onRollback lambdas, or the SyncSideEffect method which allows you to execute code during a commit, while the changed fields are still locked.   * Conditional transactions : Method Shield.Conditional allows you to define something similar to a database AFTER trigger. It receives a test, and an action to perform, both lambdas. It runs the test, makes a note of all shielded objects that the test had accessed, and later re-executes the test when any of those objects is committed into. If test passes, the action is called.     * Implemented transactionally, so can be called from transactions, and can be triggered by the transaction that created it.     * Returns an IDisposable for deactivating the subscription, also transactionally. It may even deactivate itself, e.g. to guarantee one-time execution.   * Pre-commit checks : Shield.PreCommit is very similar to Shield.Conditional, but executes the test within a transaction that changes one of the fields it is interested in, just before that transaction will commit.     * Can be used to ensure certain invariants are held, or to implement thread prioritization by allowing only some threads which access a field to commit into it.   * Custom commit operations : You can integrate your own code into the commit process, to execute while the shielded fields, that are being written, are held locked.     * Already mentioned Shield.SyncSideEffect does this on the level of one transaction.     * Using Shield.WhenCommitting, you subscribe globally for any commit, or based on the type of field being written. These subscriptions should never throw!     * Shield.RunToCommit runs a transaction just up to commit, and allows you to commit/rollback later, or from another thread. This is useful for asynchronous programming.   * Commutables : operations which can be performed without conflict, because they can be reordered in time and have the same net effect, i.e. they are commutable (name borrowed from Clojure). Incrementing an int is an example - if you don’t care what the int’s value is, you can increment it without conflict by simply incrementing whatever value you encounter there at commit time. Using commutes, when appropriate, reduces conflicts and improves concurrency. Incrementing an int, conflict-free:  @abstr_code_section      * Commutes are not performed under any lock, but rather in a special commute subtransaction, which reads the latest data, and tries to commit with the same stamp as your main transaction. If only the commutes fail, then only the commutes get retried.     * If, in the example above, your main transaction has already (or perhaps will later) read the n field or written to it (non-commutatively), the commute “degenerates” - it gets executed in place, in your transaction, and you can see it’s effect. This means consistency - if you read it, it will stay as read when you commit. But, it is now a potential conflict.     * Shield has various commutable operations defined in it.

Go @abstr_hyperlink to get it. There's a Debian package, so installation is easy; the only caveat is that it requires Java (sorry).  You can build the dev track simply by running:       $ ./build.sh dev   The first time this is run, this will download and build all dependencies (except Bazel, of course). This can take a while, so be patient. Don't expect status updates for a minute or two at a time in some cases. Subsequent builds will be extremely fast; Bazel excels at doing incremental builds.  Don't be alarmed if you see a few warnings. In particular, the linker may complain about duplicated symbols.

","Building  You need to build on Linux, and probably Ubuntu Linux. You will also need the @abstr_hyperlink build system installed. Go @abstr_hyperlink to get it. There's a Debian package, so installation is easy; the only caveat is that it requires Java (sorry).  You can build the dev track simply by running:       $ ./build.sh dev   The first time this is run, this will download and build all dependencies (except Bazel, of course). This can take a while, so be patient. Don't expect status updates for a minute or two at a time in some cases. Subsequent builds will be extremely fast; Bazel excels at doing incremental builds.  Don't be alarmed if you see a few warnings. In particular, the linker may complain about duplicated symbols.

The details of how this works isn't very important (but see @abstr_hyperlink for a detailed explanation of how exactly this trickery works) in order to just use them, but there are a few things you should know:    * If you expand the alias of a concrete DOM type, you'll discover it's actually a list of abstract types. e.g. element expands to _baseClass _element _node _eventTarget_like This means element is a subtype of _element, _node and _eventTarget_like.   * The _like type are ""open"" (because they have a type variable).

Source images can either be a png, psd __Photoshop__ or ai __Illustrator__ file. Images are generated using Ionic's image resizing and cropping server, instead of requiring special libraries and plugins to be installed locally.  Since each platform has different image requirements, it's best to make a source image for the largest size needed, and let the CLI do all the resizing, cropping and copying for you. Newly generated images will be placed in the resources directory at the root of the Cordova project. Additionally, the CLI will update and add the correct <platform> configs to the project's @abstr_hyperlink file.  During the build process, Cordova (v @abstr_number . @abstr_number or later) will look through the project's @abstr_hyperlink file and copy the newly created resource images to the platform's specific resource folder.

373,4288,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,Motivation ,"Modern large scale distributed application architectures, wherein components are distributed across the internet on multiple hosts and multiple CPU cores, are often based on a messaging or event bus that allows the various distributed components to communicate asynchronously with each other. Typically the messaging bus is some form of messaging queue service such as AMQP or ZeroMQ. The message bus supports what is commonly referred to as a publish/subscribe methodology for information exchange.  While there are many advantages to a full featured message queuing service, one of the disadvantagesis the inability to manage performance at scale.  A message queuing service performs two distinct but complementary functions.    * The first is asynchronous transport of messages over the internet.   * The second is message queue management, that is, the identification, tracking, storage, and distribution of messages between publishers and subscribers via queues.    One of the advantages of a message queuing service for many applications is that the service hides behind an API, the complexities of queue management from the clients. The disadvantage is that at scale, where the volume of messages, the timing of messages, and the associated demands on memory, network, and cpu capacity become critical, the client has little ability to tune the service for performance. Often MQ services become bottlenecks for the distributed application. The more complicated MQ services, like AMQP, tend to be unreliable under load.  Separating the function of network transport of asynchrounous event from the function of message queue management allows independant tuning at scale of each function.  Most if not all of the MQ services are based on TCP/IP for transport. TCP/IP adds significant latency to the network communications and is therefore not well suited for the asynchronous nature of distibuted event driven application communications. This is primarily due to the way TCP/IP handles connection setup and teardown as well as failed connections in order to support streams. Fundamentally TCP/IP is optomized for sending large contiguous data streams not many small aynchronous events or messages. While not a problem for small scale systems, the differences in the associated traffic characteristics can become problematic at scale.  Because UDP/IP has lower latency and is connectionless, it is much better suited to many small asynchronous messages and scales better. The drawback of bare UDP/IP is that it is not reliable. What is needed, therefore, is a tuned transport protocol that adds reliability to UDP/IP without sacrificing latency and scalability. A transactioned protocol, is much more appropriate for providing reliablity to asynchronous event transport than a streaming protocol.  Morover, because most MQ services are based on TCP/IP they tend to also use HTTP and therefore TLS/SSL for secure communications. While using HTTP provides easy integration with web based systems, it can become problematic for high performant systems Furthermore, TLS is also problematic as a security system both from performance and vulnerabilty aspects.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography, on the other hand, provides increases in security with lower performance requirements relative to over other approaches. LibSodium provides an open source Elliptic Curve Cryptographic library with support for both authentication and encryption. The CurveCP protocol is based on LibSodium and provides a handshake protocol for bootstrapping secure network exchanges of information.  Finally, one of the best ways to manage and fine tune processor resources (cpu, memory, network) in distributed concurrent event driven applications is to use something called micro-threads. A microthread is typically an in-language feature that allows logical concurrency with no more overhead than a function call. Micro threading uses cooperative multi-tasking instead of threads and/or processes and avoids many of the complexities of resource contention, context switching, and interprocess communications while providing much higher total performance.  Because all the cooperative micro-threads run in one process, a simple micro-threaded application is limited to one CPU core. To enable full utilization of all CPU cores, the application needs to be able to run at least one process per CPU core. This requires same host inter-process communications. But unlike the conventional approach to multi-processing where there is of one process per logical concurrent function, a micro-threaded multi-process application has instead one micro-thread per logical concurrent function and the total number of micro-threads is distributed amoungst a minimal number of processes, no more than the number of cpu cores. This optimizes the use of the cpu power while minimizes the overhead of process context switching.  An example of a framework that uses this type of micro-threaded but multi-process architecture is Erlang. Indeed, the success of the Erlang model provided support for the viability of the RAET approach. Indeed, one might ask, why not use Erlang? Unfortunately, the Erlang ecosystem is somewhat limited in comparison to Python's and the language itself uses what one might describe as a very unfortunate syntax. One of the design objectives behine RAET was to leverage existing Python expertise and the richness of the Python ecosystem but still be able to develop distributed applications using a micro-threaded multi-process architectural model. The goal was to combine the best of both worlds.  RAET is designed to provide secure reliable scalable asynchronous message/event transport over the internet in a micro-threaded multi-process application framework that uses UDP for interhost communication and LibSodium for authentication, encryption and the CurveCP handshake for secure bootstrap.  The queue management and micro-threaded application support is provided by Ioflo. RAET is a complementary project to Ioflo in that RAET enables multiple Ioflo applications to work together over a network as part of a distributed application.  The primary use case and motivating problem that resulted in the development of RAET was the need to enable SaltStack to scale better. SaltStack is a remote execution and configuration management platform written in Python. SaltStack uses ZeroMQ ( @abstr_number MQ) as its message bus or message queuing service. ZeroMQ is based on TCP/IP so suffers from the aforementioned latency and non-asynchronicity issues of TCP/IP based architectures. Moreover because ZeroMQ integrates queue management and transport in a monolithic way with special ""sockets"", tuning the performance of the queuing independent of the transport at scale becomes problematic. Tracing down bugs can also be problematic.

A message queuing service performs two distinct but complementary functions.    * The first is asynchronous transport of messages over the internet.   * The second is message queue management, that is, the identification, tracking, storage, and distribution of messages between publishers and subscribers via queues.    One of the advantages of a message queuing service for many applications is that the service hides behind an API, the complexities of queue management from the clients. The disadvantage is that at scale, where the volume of messages, the timing of messages, and the associated demands on memory, network, and cpu capacity become critical, the client has little ability to tune the service for performance. Often MQ services become bottlenecks for the distributed application. The more complicated MQ services, like AMQP, tend to be unreliable under load.  Separating the function of network transport of asynchrounous event from the function of message queue management allows independant tuning at scale of each function.  Most if not all of the MQ services are based on TCP/IP for transport. TCP/IP adds significant latency to the network communications and is therefore not well suited for the asynchronous nature of distibuted event driven application communications. This is primarily due to the way TCP/IP handles connection setup and teardown as well as failed connections in order to support streams. Fundamentally TCP/IP is optomized for sending large contiguous data streams not many small aynchronous events or messages. While not a problem for small scale systems, the differences in the associated traffic characteristics can become problematic at scale.  Because UDP/IP has lower latency and is connectionless, it is much better suited to many small asynchronous messages and scales better. The drawback of bare UDP/IP is that it is not reliable. What is needed, therefore, is a tuned transport protocol that adds reliability to UDP/IP without sacrificing latency and scalability. A transactioned protocol, is much more appropriate for providing reliablity to asynchronous event transport than a streaming protocol.  Morover, because most MQ services are based on TCP/IP they tend to also use HTTP and therefore TLS/SSL for secure communications. While using HTTP provides easy integration with web based systems, it can become problematic for high performant systems Furthermore, TLS is also problematic as a security system both from performance and vulnerabilty aspects.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography, on the other hand, provides increases in security with lower performance requirements relative to over other approaches. LibSodium provides an open source Elliptic Curve Cryptographic library with support for both authentication and encryption. The CurveCP protocol is based on LibSodium and provides a handshake protocol for bootstrapping secure network exchanges of information.  Finally, one of the best ways to manage and fine tune processor resources (cpu, memory, network) in distributed concurrent event driven applications is to use something called micro-threads. A microthread is typically an in-language feature that allows logical concurrency with no more overhead than a function call. Micro threading uses cooperative multi-tasking instead of threads and/or processes and avoids many of the complexities of resource contention, context switching, and interprocess communications while providing much higher total performance.  Because all the cooperative micro-threads run in one process, a simple micro-threaded application is limited to one CPU core. To enable full utilization of all CPU cores, the application needs to be able to run at least one process per CPU core. This requires same host inter-process communications. But unlike the conventional approach to multi-processing where there is of one process per logical concurrent function, a micro-threaded multi-process application has instead one micro-thread per logical concurrent function and the total number of micro-threads is distributed amoungst a minimal number of processes, no more than the number of cpu cores. This optimizes the use of the cpu power while minimizes the overhead of process context switching.  An example of a framework that uses this type of micro-threaded but multi-process architecture is Erlang. Indeed, the success of the Erlang model provided support for the viability of the RAET approach. Indeed, one might ask, why not use Erlang? Unfortunately, the Erlang ecosystem is somewhat limited in comparison to Python's and the language itself uses what one might describe as a very unfortunate syntax. One of the design objectives behine RAET was to leverage existing Python expertise and the richness of the Python ecosystem but still be able to develop distributed applications using a micro-threaded multi-process architectural model. The goal was to combine the best of both worlds.  RAET is designed to provide secure reliable scalable asynchronous message/event transport over the internet in a micro-threaded multi-process application framework that uses UDP for interhost communication and LibSodium for authentication, encryption and the CurveCP handshake for secure bootstrap.  The queue management and micro-threaded application support is provided by Ioflo. RAET is a complementary project to Ioflo in that RAET enables multiple Ioflo applications to work together over a network as part of a distributed application.  The primary use case and motivating problem that resulted in the development of RAET was the need to enable SaltStack to scale better. SaltStack is a remote execution and configuration management platform written in Python. SaltStack uses ZeroMQ ( @abstr_number MQ) as its message bus or message queuing service. ZeroMQ is based on TCP/IP so suffers from the aforementioned latency and non-asynchronicity issues of TCP/IP based architectures. Moreover because ZeroMQ integrates queue management and transport in a monolithic way with special ""sockets"", tuning the performance of the queuing independent of the transport at scale becomes problematic. Tracing down bugs can also be problematic.  ","1,1"

There are many different input field data-types and each have different filters, validation methods, and options that dictate what kind of data they can or can not accept, and how the input fields will look and behave. These types have been developed to meet the typical needs of what would be desired from an online form, such as a phone number type, an email type, a regular text input type, and many more. If you would like to see a full list of the input types that are available to you with formBuilder please feel free to look ahead to the Data Types section in the User Guide.  It is also possible, if these types do not meet the requirements of what is needed for a form that is being built, to easily design a custom input type by modifying a set of base methods, or developing a regular expression to define what input will be allowed in the new type.

You feel that you have no control over your own computer. (And it's not how an open Web is supposed to work.)   * You want to get rid of any closed-source technology or proprietary JavaScript code, and disallow things like Flash running on your computer.   * You are an adherent of hacker culture and free software.    What you-get can do for you:    * Download videos / audios from popular websites such as YouTube, Youku, Niconico, and a bunch more. (See the full list of supported sites)   * Stream an online video in your media player. No web browser, no more ads.   * Download images (of interest) by scraping a web page.   * Download arbitrary non-HTML contents, i.e., binary files.    Interested?

388,4493,https://github.com/mraimi/insight2,Implementation details ,"Submission by Michael Raimi (raimi.michael@gmail.com)   I decided to represent the graph as an adjacency list keyed by username which I assumed to be unique. This assumption was supported by the numerical suffixes on names such as 'Caroline-Kaiser- @abstr_number '. The value of the adjacency list is a tuple of the node's degree count and a set of neighbors the node shares an edge with. It's a set to prevent any bookkeeping issues in the event of records with the same target/actor pair.  The @abstr_number second window is represented by a list (used essentially as a queue) of tuples of target, actor, datetime records. It is always in order by timestamp and has linear insertion on out of order nodes but is O( @abstr_number ) otherwise.  NOTE: In the event that multiple records in the same @abstr_number second window have the same target/actor pair multiple records in the window are created with unique datetimes but no new edges are created, and as a result no degree counts are modified. This has the same effect as updating the edge's timestamp.  Below are other data structures and counts used to support graph operations and modifications:    * There is a dictionary keeping track of how many instances of a certain degree exist in the graph e.g. there are @abstr_number nodes with degree @abstr_number .    * There is a list of integers that represents the current degree values in the graph e.g. there are nodes of degree @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number , and so on. It's always sorted.    * There is a total node count used for sanity checking and to lookup the median    * There is a dictionary keeping count of how many times a unique target/actor pair is received. The size of this data structure is linear in the number of edges and vertices of the graph multiplied by some factor d, which represents the highest number of records made by a single target/actor pair. In Big-O it would be O(d(V + E)). This implementation would be prohibitive in the case where a few power users make tons of transactions. An alternative implementation to this would be to remove the old record from the window and insert the new one in the correct position. This would have linear processing cost in the size of records in the window but could reduce the memory footprint by a constant factor.

389,4502,https://github.com/johnsonyang/compass,框架工作流程 ,"Compass框架工作流程如下图所示：  @abstr_image  @abstr_number . 上层应用(比如Action层)对Service层的调用会被数据源切换预处理器所拦截，数据源切换预处理器收集分库路由键，主从库读写策略(决定本次访问应该读取主库还是从库)、Service方法名、主从库反延时键保存在threadLocal里面的RouteContext对象中，供后续步骤使用。  @abstr_number . Service层调用Dao层的方法执行数据库操作的时候，会通过Spring JdbcTemplate、MyBatis和Hibernate等数据访问层框架访问到分库数据源ShardDataSource。  @abstr_number .

ShardDataSource路由到某个MasterSlaveDataSource之后,MasterSlaveDataSource会进一步根据保存在threadLocal中的RouteContext里面的用户配置的主从库读写策略和主从库反延时策略来进行主从选择。如果选择读取从库，那么需要进一步根据用户配置的负载均衡策略在多个从库之间进行负载均衡，同时如果有从库出现故障还需要及时探测到并进行HA，MasterSlaveDataSource最终会选择出一个单库数据源SingleDataSource来进行操作。  @abstr_number .

Service层调用Dao层的方法执行数据库操作的时候，会通过Spring JdbcTemplate、MyBatis和Hibernate等数据访问层框架访问到分库数据源ShardDataSource。  @abstr_number .

In order to detect these mistakes, the salt engine needs to read your state, and apply it with the grains and pillars appropriate for the minion you are targeting.  Salt makes it very easy to test with an active master (or similar situations such as a masterless setup, or salt-ssh) by putting the state on the master (or similar) and calling the test_state, e.g.:  @abstr_code_section  This will display the state when it renders. However, the cost of this is longer than what's ideal.  In order to provide a slightly faster unit testing cycle, as well as a pre-commit hook that can be used to prevent unintended errors from getting into git, this script can do much of the same compilation as a salt master and the state.show_sls state (this uses the show_sls state).

Pillar data is provided as a json file rather than data collected by the saltmaster.  For each state that is being tested, a pseudo-run is initiated.

Once that data is obtained, the pseudo-run is executed and the state.show_sls function is used to return the data structure that is the result of the state being rendered.  To test a hypothesis, it's important to have an hypothesis in the first place. The results of the pseudo-run are compared with the desired results. Any differences present in the relevent keys cause the run in general to fail (this is to support acting as a git hook, so that a broken state isn't committed).

In order to define the way your various virtual items (Goods, Coins ...) are purchased, you'll need to create your implementation of IStoreAsset (the same one from step @abstr_number in the ""Getting Started"" above).  Here is an example:  Lets say you have a _VirtualCurrencyPack_ you call TEN_COINS_PACK and a _VirtualCurrency_ you call COIN_CURRENCY:  @abstr_code_section  Now you can use _StoreInventory_ to buy your new VirtualCurrencyPack:  @abstr_code_section  And that's it! unity @abstr_number d-store knows how to contact Google Play or the App Store for you and will redirect your users to their purchasing system to complete the transaction. Don't forget to subscribe to store events in order to get the notified of successful or failed purchases (see @abstr_hyperlink ).  ",3

A simplest parser that parse just a single character:       //Parse a single char 'a'     var charParser = yamp.Char('a');     var result = yamp.Parse(charParser, 'a');   More complex parsers can be created with parser combiners functions:       //Parse a stream of chars that can contains  @abstr_number  to unlimited chars 'a'     var charStreamParser = yamp.Many(yamp.Char('a'));     var result = yamp.Parse(charStreamParser, 'aaaaa');   Yamp has fluent API to help configuring parsers:       //Parsers can be configured with method chaining     var charStreamParser = yamp.Char('a').Many();     var result = charStreamParser.Parse('aaaaa');   Unlike traditional parsers (ANTLR, yacc) yamp doesn`t have separate stages for lexical and syntax parse. If input string can contains comments, you need to remove them before calling yamp parser - or include comments support into parser (than can really challenging task depending on DLS complexity).

The count resets to @abstr_number if the Counter reaches the maximum, or if the tree begins a new update. You can change this behavior by setting the optional parameter resetOnReady to false.

4,27,https://github.com/3rinN3lson/ai-tree-plugin,Running Status ,"If you set the status of a node to STATUS_RUNNING, its parent will return STATUS_SUCCESS, then skip straight to it on the next traversal. This can be handy for tasks that take more than a single frame to complete.  For example, a character might want to walk to a door and open it. You might do it something like this:    * Movement Sequencer     * Walk To Door (returns STATUS_RUNNING if it hasn't reached the door)     * Open Door    Although it is a sequencer, the Movement Sequencer will not move on to Open Door until Walk To Door has completed its run.  By default, while outer nodes do set their parents to STATUS_RUNNING, inner nodes do not, and instead revert to STATUS_SUCCESS. This is by design. Imagine a tree which uses running to control a guard on patrol. The guard walks between several waypoints in sequence: each waypoint is an action node which returns STATUS_RUNNING when it is walking and STATUS_SUCCESS when it gets to the destination. So far so good. But what if we now add a branch that checks and chases intruders?    * Guard Behaviour Selector     * Detect Intruder Sequencer       * Is there an Intruder?       * Chase Them     * Patrol Sequencer       * Waypoint @abstr_number       * Waypoint @abstr_number       * Waypoint @abstr_number    If an intruder appears while the guard is walking between waypoints, we want the guard to immediately abandon their route and give chase. If the Patrol Sequencer were set to STATUS_RUNNING, the guard's AI would immediately run it, skipping past the Detect Intruder Sequencer. This means the guard would only be able to see intruders when they reach Waypoint @abstr_number and the Patrol Sequencer finally succeeded, freeing the tree for a single update.  This is undesirable, so we disable inheritance of STATUS_RUNNING in inner nodes.  However, sometimes you want that inheritance to occur. For example, consider the AI of a deadly assassin robot:    * Termination Protocol Selector     * Logistics Sequencer       * Are we out of milk?       * Go to shop (running)       * Pick up some milk (running)       * Come home (running)     * PsyOps Sequencer       * Is it Saturday night?       * Go to the club (running)       * Boogie (running)       * Come home (running)     * Read a book (running)    If our assassin robot is in the middle of a funky funky boogie, we do not want to suddenly trigger a milk shopping expedition. That is socially bogus. So we want the Logistics Sequencer and PsyOps Sequencer to signal the Termination Protocol Selector that they are also running if their children are running. But how?  You can reactivate STATUS_RUNNING inheritance by creating nodes with the runsParent parameter or property:  @abstr_code_section  If runsParent is true, a node that receives STATUS_RUNNING will also become STATUS_RUNNING. This allows you to create a tree or tree segment that remembers its current position, even in complicated nested structures.  Note that outer nodes set runsParent to true by default. You can set this to false in the normal fashion. This will prevent them from using any running functionality whatsoever.

However, these metrics can also be used      in isolation, and without ordination via reciprocal averaging, and      instead, ordering along some biological gradient.   Definition of a metacommunity:       A metacommunity is a set of sites (e.g. plants in plant-pollinator      networks) associated through interactions (e.g. insect species      (columns) interact with plant species (rows) in plant-pollinator      networks). The pattern-based metacommunity concept, proposed by      Leibold & Mikkelson  @abstr_number  and expounded on by Presley et al.  @abstr_number ,      allows for the evaluation of metacommunity structure by using      randomization techniques to discern between  @abstr_number  patterns of      metacommunity structure. This is performed by ordinating      site-by-species interaction matrices and calculating three      metrics; coherence, boundary clumping & turnover.   The Elements of Metacommunity Structure Framework:        The metacom package calculates these three metrics; coherence is      calculated using the function Coherence(), boundary clumping with      BoundaryClump(), and turnover (from either species or range      perspective) using the Turnover() function. These functions are      consolidated in the metacommunity() function, which can be used to      calculate all three metrics. In order to interpret the output of      these functions, it will be helpful to read Leibold & Mikkelson       @abstr_number  and Presley et al.  @abstr_number , but to also read Ulrich and Gotelli       @abstr_number , as this paper outlines the difficulty seemingly inherent      with investigating community structure. Also, these functions do      not have to be used strictly in the Leibold and Mikkelson  @abstr_number      framework.   A cautionary note:       I caution the user to be aware that the creation of null matrices      can be performed to allow (or not allow) sites to be empty, or      species to not exist at any site (i.e. column sums and/or row sums      are allowed to be zero). This is controlled by the logical      argument 'allow.empty' in the Metacommunity(), NullMaker(),      Coherence(), and Turnover() functions. Restricting nulls to not      allow empty rows or columns may be biologically realistic, but it      also reduces the number of unique null matrices that can be built,      which will impact computation time, making it infeasible or      impossible in some situations. These situations occur when you      have a very sparse interaction matrix, and is also influenced by      null model algorithm ('method') that you choose.

16,8,https://github.com/adtools/clib2,The thread-safe library ,"Thread-safety does not imply that you can have multiple callers access and close the same file. There is no resource tracking to that degree yet. All that the thread-safety tries to afford you is not to get into big trouble if simultaneous and overlapping accesses to files, memory allocation and other resources are taking place.  The library code is supposed to be thread-safe if built with the __THREAD_SAFE preprocessor symbol defined. Note that 'thread-safe' does not mean 'reentrant'. Multiple callers for certain library functions are permitted, but not for all of them. For example, mkdtemp() is not thread-safe, and neither is rand() or localtime(). But as per *POSIX @abstr_number . @abstr_number c- @abstr_number * there are thread-safe variants of rand() and localtime() called rand_r(), localtime_r(), and others.  The use of the socket I/O functions is problematic because the underlying bsdsocket.library API is not supposed to be used by any process other than the one which opened it. While one TCP/IP stack (my own ""Roadshow"") allows you to share the library base among different processes, if so configured, it is the exception. No other TCP/IP stack available for the Amiga robustly supports a similar feature. If the TCP/IP stack supports this feature, then the global variable __can_share_socket_library_base will be set to a non-zero value.  Errors reported by the socket I/O functions which modify the global variables errno and h_errno may be directed to call the __set_errno() and __set_h_errno() functions instead, if the TCP/IP stack supports this feature. The global variable __thread_safe_errno_h_errno will be set to a non-zero value if it does.  A much more serious problem resides with the exit(), abort(), assert() and raise() functions, and how the SIGINT signal is processed. In the thread-safe library only the main() function may directly or indirectly call the exit() function. No child process may do so, since this would wreck its stack context, crashing it instantly; the main program would be very likely to crash, too, because exit() will clean up after all memory allocations and files currently in use. Functions such as abort() and raise() may call the exit() function indirectly. And the raise() function may be invoked as part of the Control+C checking. You should make sure that the signal handling does not affect any child processes. This can be done by replacing the __check_abort() function or by disabling SIGINT processing altogether, such as through a signal(SIGINT,SIG_IGN) call.  Also take care with file I/O involving the stdin/stdout/stderr streams; read/write operations on these streams will be mapped to the Input()/Output()/ErrorOutput() file handles of the process performing these operations. Since only this small set of operations is mapped, functions such as fcntl() or select() will not work on the stdin/stdout/stderr streams and the corresponding file descriptors STDIN_FILENO/STDOUT_FILENO/STDERR_FILENO. It is therefore strongly recommended to use the thread-safe library only for applications which can cope with the limitations described above.

If one choose the optimization mode one should also define the correct optimization flags in the file scripts/check_system.sh, even if there are some default settings. If unsure don't use the optimization option.  In the third menu one has to define if one need to install all packages to run a simulation. If unsure choose _Yes_.

They are essential when extending network functionality and providing additional security. However, these so called middleboxes are not explicitly considered in the original TCP/IP-based network architecture. As a result, the protocols of the TCP/IP suite provide middleboxes with the same information about data flows as packet-forwarding routers. Yet, middleboxes typically perform complex functions within the network that require additional knowledge. Inferring this knowledge from observing the sparse information available in network packets requires these devices to base their decisions on ambiguous or forgeable data. Priv-Seams is designed to counter problems arising from such insufficient information and identify the resulting informational requirements of middleboxes. It is a signaling layer that enables end hosts to provide middleboxes with descriptive and verifiable data flow contexts in order to allow for more secure and richer middlebox functions in home and enterprise network scenarios than provided by today’s middleboxes. Furthermore, it provides extensions to the SEAMS signaling protocol that take privacy concerns of transmitting such descriptive and verifiable contexts on the signaling path into consideration. The evaluation of SEAMS and its extensions (https://github.com/anupash/privseams/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf), shows that they can be a feasible addition to TCP/IP-based networks and that they support multiple on-path middleboxes.

A successful command always returns @abstr_number (zero-code), and a command that has failed returns a non-zero value (error code). Failure codes must be positive integers between @abstr_number and @abstr_number .  Another handy command we can use when writing a script is exit. This command is used to terminate the current execution and deliver an exit code to the shell. Running an exit code without any arguments, will terminate the running script and return the exit code of the last command executed before exit.  When a program terminates, the shell assigns its exit code to the $? environment variable. The $? variable is how we usually test whether a script has succeeded or not in its execution.  In the same way we can use exit to terminate a script, we can use the return command to exit a function and return an exit code to the caller. You can use exit inside a function too and this will exit the function _and_ terminate the program.  ","Exit codes  Every command returns an exit code ( return status or exit status ). A successful command always returns @abstr_number (zero-code), and a command that has failed returns a non-zero value (error code). Failure codes must be positive integers between @abstr_number and @abstr_number .  Another handy command we can use when writing a script is exit. This command is used to terminate the current execution and deliver an exit code to the shell. Running an exit code without any arguments, will terminate the running script and return the exit code of the last command executed before exit.  When a program terminates, the shell assigns its exit code to the $? environment variable. The $? variable is how we usually test whether a script has succeeded or not in its execution.

The library can compute a solution camera in any chosen amount of time (e.g., @abstr_number milliseconds). For complex problems, however, more time will in general translate into better solutions. It is also possible to split the computation between a few successive frames.  The library uses a stochastic solver based on Particle Swarm Optimization to find the best camera. A detailed explanation can be found in @abstr_hyperlink .  ","1,2"

68,3,https://github.com/ArieLeo/Unity-ViewpointComputation,Example Scene ,"An example scene (as a .unitypackage) is provided @abstr_hyperlink and represents an office with four characters. After importing the package into your project, open ""VCDemoScene"". In the scene, the ""Main Camera"" object has a VCTesting script component which allows one to define the targets that we want to frame. In the example scene, the predefined targets are ""BookShelf"", ""Matteo"", and ""Chair @abstr_number "". Code in VCTesting.cs then defines, for each target, a number of visual properties that should be satisfied, namely desired values for size, visibility, and angle with the camera.  After playing the scene, press ""p"" to compute and show a camera that satisifies these properties, and ""e"" to evaluate how much the current camera satisfies the same properties (results are shown in the console). As you can see, each time you press ""p"" a different camera is generated. This is due to the stochastic nature of the solving process.  While in the Editor scene view, you can test our modified ""Visibility-Aware Framing"" command by selecting any object and then pressing the 'h' key. The editor scene camera will then be modified to frame the selected objects similarly to the normal ""Frame Selected"" Unity command, but also rotating the editor camera to ensure visibility of the selected objects.

78,4,https://github.com/ashank/android_page_curl,Some details ,"Implementation can be divided roughly in two parts.    * CurlMesh - which handles actual curl calculations and everything related to its rendering.   * CurlView - which is responsible for providing rendering environment - but more importantly - handles curl manipulation. Meaning it receives touch events and repositions curl based on them. While this sounds something utterly trivial, it really isn't, and becomes more complex if curl didn't happen around a cylinder. Depending on what you're trying to achieve of course. For me it was most important from the beginning that 'paper edge' follows pointer at all times.    Anyway, here are a few links describing this page curl implementation somewhat well. Only difference is that instead of using a static grid an algorithm which 'splits' rectangle dynamically regarding curl position and direction was implemented. This is done in order to get better render quality and to reduce polygon count. It's an absolute win-win situation if these things can be combined with limited amount of extra calculation to ease the work of renderer. In this particular case, we really do not want to draw polygons separately if they lie next to each other on same plane. It's more appropriate to have more vertices used for drawing rotating part instead. On negative side lots of code complexity comes from the need for creating a triangle strip for rendering. Using a solid grid such problems do not occur at all.    * Page Flip @abstr_number D [http://nomtek.com/tips-for-developers/page-flip- @abstr_number d/]   * Page Flip @abstr_number D [http://nomtek.com/tips-for-developers/page-flip- @abstr_number d/]    It isn't very difficult to see what happens here once you take a paper and simply curl it to some direction. If you fold paper completely, cylinder, curl happens around, radius becomes zero, making it more of a @abstr_number D effect. And likewise folding the paper so that curl radius is constant most of the characteristics remain - most importantly there is a line - at the center of this 'cylinder' - which has constant slope not dependent on radius. Its distance from the point you're holding the paper varies only. Keeping this in mind makes curl position handling based on touch events a lot easier compared to using a cone as solid curling is done around. For information on using a cone, it's highly recommended to take a look on W. Dana Nuon's @abstr_hyperlink on the topic. Chris Luke's @abstr_hyperlink is a good read too, even though he came to pretty much the same conclusion as me, better to go with cylinder instead.  Curl/cylinder is defined with three parameters, position, which is any point on a line collinear to curl. Direction vector which tells direction curl 'opens to'. And curl/cylinder radius. 'Paper' is first translated and rotated; curl position translates to origin and then rotated so that curl opens to right ( @abstr_number , @abstr_number ). This transformation makes it a bit easier to calculate rotating vertices as all vertices which have x -coordinate at least @abstr_number are not affected. Vertices which have x -coordinate between (-PI _radius, @abstr_number ) are within 'curl', and if x -coordinate is less than equal to -PI_ radius they are completely rotated. And scan line algorithm for splitting lines within rotating area is more simple as scan lines are always vertical. Not to forget rotating happens around y -axis as cylinder center is positioned at x = @abstr_number . And after we translate these vertices back to original position we have a curl which direction heads to direction vector and it's center is located at given curl position.  @abstr_number . At first there is a piece of paper represented by @abstr_number vertices at its corners. @abstr_image @abstr_number . And let's say we want to curl it approximately like this. @abstr_image @abstr_number . Which could results in something like these vertices. Adding more scan lines within the rotating area increases its quality. But the idea remains, bounding lines of original rectangle are split on more/less dense basis. @abstr_image   But, once again, using a piece of paper and doing some experiments by yourself works much more as a proper explanation than words, mine at least, can tell.

81,9,https://github.com/ashank/drag-sort-listview,DragSortListView.DropListener ,"The DropListener interface has a single callback: @abstr_code_section This is called upon completion of the drag-sort; i.e. when the floating View is dropped. The parameter from is the ListView item that was originally dragged, and to is the position where the item was dropped. This is an important callback; without a DropListener, DSLV is for all practical purposes useless.  For proper DSLV operation, this callback must perform a reordering of the data in your ListAdapter. For example, one often has a Cursor that pulls from a database and backs a CursorAdapter. The order of items in the Cursor is fixed; therefore, given drag-sorting, you must implement a mapping from Cursor positions to DSLV positions. This is commonly done within in a custom ListAdapter or CursorWrapper that implements the DropListener interface. See Issue # @abstr_number for a discussion of this. Update : Or simply use the DragSortCursorAdapter class!  If your DSLV instance android:choiceMode is not ""none"", and your ListAdapter does not have stable ids, you must call DragSortListView.moveCheckState(int from, int to) within drop(from, to). See the documentation in the DSLV API for more info.  ","DragSortListView.DropListener  The DropListener interface has a single callback: @abstr_code_section This is called upon completion of the drag-sort; i.e. when the floating View is dropped. The parameter from is the ListView item that was originally dragged, and to is the position where the item was dropped. This is an important callback; without a DropListener, DSLV is for all practical purposes useless.  For proper DSLV operation, this callback must perform a reordering of the data in your ListAdapter. For example, one often has a Cursor that pulls from a database and backs a CursorAdapter. The order of items in the Cursor is fixed; therefore, given drag-sorting, you must implement a mapping from Cursor positions to DSLV positions.

You can copy much of this class into your own App, but again be sure to substitute your own package name in where applicable (the BroadcastReceiver attributes need to be changed). You will also need to change the SENDER_ID constant to your own (see the documentation for Configuring GCM with PushSharp in the wiki). Finally, in this class, you will probably want to change what happens in some of the GCMIntentService methods. In the OnRegistered, you would want to send the registration ID to your server, so that you can use it to send the device notifications. You get the point.  ",3

It you want to take it in a different direction and make your own customized skeleton, then just maintain your own fork.  Q: Why the /shared/ symlink stuff for uploads? A: For local development, create /shared/ (it is ignored by Git), and have the files live there. For production, have your deploy script (Capistrano is my choice) look for symlinks pointing to /shared/ and repoint them to some outside-the-repo location (like an NFS shared directory or something).

Using this index, we can compute the jaccard similarity between any two items by simply doing a lookup into our pre-computed arrays (the set intersection and union in jaccard can be transformed to arithmetic on counts retrieved from the array).  The final step of the algorithm is to simply find the K nearest neighbors of each item using the accelerated jaccard lookup.

Storing the full co-concurrency matrix would require O(n^ @abstr_number ) memory as the number of unique items in the dataset grows.  To still process large-ish datasets, we use a hash function to map the input item ids into a number of buckets. We then scan the input data multiple times, once for each bucket.

For this to work we create the hosts named x{ @abstr_number , @abstr_number , @abstr_number }.db.skydns.local in etcd:       curl -XPUT http:// @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number : @abstr_number /v @abstr_number /keys/skydns/local/skydns/db/x @abstr_number  -d \         value='{""host"":"" @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number ""}'     curl -XPUT http:// @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number : @abstr_number /v @abstr_number /keys/skydns/local/skydns/db/x @abstr_number  -d \         value='{""host"": "" @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number ""'}     curl -XPUT http:// @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number : @abstr_number /v @abstr_number /keys/skydns/local/skydns/db/x @abstr_number  -d \         value='{""host"": "" @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number . @abstr_number ""'}   Now the name db.skydns.local is the ""load balanced"" name for the database, SkyDNS will round-robin by default in this case unless -round-robin=false is enabled.
