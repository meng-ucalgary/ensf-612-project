DC/OS Vagrant
==================

Quickly provision a [DC/OS](https://github.com/dcos/dcos) cluster on a local machine for development, testing, or demonstration.

Deploying DC/OS Vagrant involves creating a local cluster of VirtualBox VMs using the [dcos-vagrant-box](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant-box) base image and then installing [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/).
