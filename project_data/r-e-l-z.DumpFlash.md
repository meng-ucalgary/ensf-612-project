   * Updated by O.Kleinecke in March/April 2015 to improve LP-NAND-Chip support.
   * KNOWN ISSUES : TODO : Add (cleaner!?) OOB/ECC Support for LP-Devices.
   * TODO : Add create/read BBT functions
   * Investigate FTDI/Code based malwritten/malread bytes (byte mismatch for read/write after chip erase every 256/256+1/256+2 bytes)
