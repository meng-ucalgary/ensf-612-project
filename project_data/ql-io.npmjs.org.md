# Project layout

registry/ is the JSON API for the package registry.

www/ is the code for search.npmjs.org, eventually maybe www.npmjs.org

# Installing

You'll need CouchDB version 1.1.0 or higher.  We're using some newish features.
I recommend getting one from http://iriscouch.com/

Once you have CouchDB installed, create a new database:

    curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/registry

Clone the repository if you haven't already, and cd into it:

    git clone https://github.com/isaacs/npmjs.org.git
    cd npmjs.org

Now install couchapp and semver:

    [sudo] npm install couchapp -g
    npm install couchapp
    npm install semver

Sync the registry and search:

    couchapp push registry/app.js http://localhost:5984/registry
    couchapp push www/app.js http://localhost:5984/registry

You may need to put a username and password in the URL:

    couchapp push www/app.js http://user:pass@localhost:5984/registry
    couchapp push registry/app.js http://user:pass@localhost:5984/registry

To synchronize from the public npm registry to your private registry,
create a replication task from http://isaacs.ic.ht/registry --> local
database registry. This can be done through Futon (the CouchDB administrative
UI) or via an HTTP call to '/_replicate like so:

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
        http://localhost:5984/_replicate -d \
        '{"source":"http://isaacs.iriscouch.com/registry/", "target":"registry"}'

# Using the registry with the npm client

With the setup so far, you can point the npm client at the registry by
putting this in your ~/.npmrc file:

    registry = http://localhost:5984/registry/_design/app/_rewrite

You can also set the npm registry config property like:

    npm config set registry http://localhost:5984/registry/_design/app/_rewrite

Or you can simple override the registry config on each call:

    npm --registry http://localhost:5984/registry/_design/app/_rewrite install <package>

# Optional: top-of-host urls

To be snazzier, add a vhost config:

    [vhosts]
    registry.mydomain.com:5984 = /registry/_design/app/_rewrite
    search.mydomain.com:5984 = /registry/_design/ui/_rewrite


Where `registry.mydomain.com` and `search.mydomain.com` are
the hostnames where you're running the thing, and `5984` is the
port that CouchDB is running on. If you're running on port 80,
then omit the port altogether.

Then for example you can reference the repository like so:

    npm config set registry http://registry.mydomain.com:5984
