### Initialize the MnuboClient

```python
from mnubo.mnubo_client import MnuboClient

mnubo = MnuboClient('CLIENT_ID', 'CLIENT_SECRET', 'HOSTNAME')
```

### Use the Owner Services
To create owners on the mnubo SmartObject platform, please refer to
the data modeling guide to format correctly the owner's data structure.

#### Create an Owner
```python
response = mnubo.owner_services.create('OWNER_IN_JSON')
```

#### Claim a Smart Object for an Owner
```python
response = mnubo.owner_services.claim('USERNAME', 'DEVICE_ID')
```

#### Update an Owner
```python
response = mnubo.owner_services.update('OWNER_IN_JSON')
```

#### Delete an Owner
```python
response = mnubo.owner_services.delete('USERNAME')
```

### Use the Smart Objects Services
To create smart objects on the mnubo SmartObject platform, please refer to
the data modeling guide to format correctly the smart object's data structure.

#### Create a Smart Object
```python
response = mnubo.smart_object_services.create('OBJECT_IN_JSON')
```

#### Update a Smart Object
```python
response = mnubo.smart_object_services.update('OBJECT_IN_JSON')
```

#### Delete a Smart Object
```python
response = mnubo.smart_object_services.delete('DEVICE_ID')
```

### Use the Event Services
To send events to the mnubo SmartObject platform, please refer to
the data modeling guide to format correctly the event's data structure.

#### Send an Event
```python
response = mnubo.event_services.send('EVENT_IN_JSON')
```

### Use the Search Services
To send search queries to the mnubo SmartObject platform, please refer to
the Search API documentation to format your queries correctly.

#### Search Query
```python
response = mnubo.search_services.search('QUERY')
```

#### Search Datasets Query
```python
response = mnubo.search_services.search_datasets('QUERY')
```

### Use the Batch Services
To create or update owners or objects in batch, please refer to the Batch section
of either the SmartObject or the Owners in the API documentation to format the data correctly.

#### Batch Owners
```python
response = mnubo.batch_services.owners('OWNERS_IN_JSON')
```

#### Batch Objects
```python
response = mnubo.batch_services.objects('OBJECTS_IN_JSON')
```
