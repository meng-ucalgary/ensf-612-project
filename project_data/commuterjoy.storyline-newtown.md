<h1><a href="/events/Newtown_Shootings/background">Newtown_Shootings</a></h1>

<p>I've retrospectivly taken the body of journalism that was produced over seven days after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown (approx ~120 articles). 

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>

 <li>This is a UX for medium-sized news story, designed to support the exploration of it.

 <li>The UX is centered around events. The four key events in the timeline are effectively filters for the analysis, commentary etc. we produce. Nb. The working theory is that 
	_events of the world_ are what drives people's interest in News, and what our journalists spend time researching and writing about.

 <li>The _initiating_ event 'Newtown Shootings' was the thing  that drew people to the story, but most of the words we wrote were about the reaction to that event (Eg, Obama, NRA) or 
	 reflections on the issues (Eg, Gun Control, Media's (mis)reporting of key facts etc.))

</ul>

<h2>Todo</h2>

<ul>

 
 <li> <s>Represent minor updates to the story.</s> See <a href="/events/Newtown_Shootings/latest">latest feed</a>. The idea here is if you've come
	back to the story after a week you can quickly tell if anything much has happened. News for people with a surface-level interest. 
 
 <li> Representing 'Live' running commentary.
 
 <li> Interlinking external events (Eg. Arizona cinema massacre, President Obama's second term, US Healthcare system's mental health).

 <li> I've started to merge article (Eg, pictures) in to a single articles. I need to do more of this with the news reports. 

 <li> Show the before / during / after states.

 <li> Personalisation layer sits on top (Eg. regular visitor, first time visitor, skim reading)

 <li> Analysis can be cut lots of ways (Eg. politically left/right, pro/anti gun control, USA/Europe perspective)

 <li> Reactions are interesting - lots of first-hand and/or eyewitness reactions are embedded in to our new reports. What would happen if we broke these out?</li>

 <li> Where do comments sit? Do people comment on articles? Or events? Both? This would create an opportunity to comment on the events in general.

 <li> L4z0rw0lf - this could do with some idea of importance / popularity</li>

 <li> Representing external stories (Eg, what does the BBC think of this)

</ul>

<h2>Thoughts on story size.</h2>

<ul>

  <li>We publish a lot of stories where we don't say an awful lot beyond the facts ("Boy jumps off ferry", etc.). This UX isn't suitable for these sorts of things.

  <li>We publish tags for big or long running stories (Eg, Global economic crisis 2010-2012, Middle-East). Maybe these aren't stories, more like themes of our time. I feel that we shouldn't 
	worry about representing these too much.

  <li>Stories can be short lived (Eg, Sandy Hook, Fiscal cliff) where people's interest is temporary, or long running (Eg, Greek debt crisis) where interest is periodic.

</ul>
