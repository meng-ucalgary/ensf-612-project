## DESCRIPTION:

Gem that allows you to encrypt a Chef Data Bag Item using the public keys of
a list of chef nodes. This allows only those chef nodes to decrypt the
encrypted values.

For a more detailed explanation of how chef-vault works, please refer to this blog post [Chef Vault â€“ what is it and what can it do for you?](https://www.chef.io/blog/2016/01/21/chef-vault-what-is-it-and-what-can-it-do-for-you/) by Nell Shamrell-Harrington.

## INSTALLATION:

Be sure you are running the latest version Chef. Versions earlier than
0.10.0 don't support plugins:

    gem install chef

This plugin is distributed as a Ruby Gem. To install it, run:

    gem install chef-vault

Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to run this command
with root privileges.

## KNIFE COMMANDS:

See KNIFE_EXAMPLES.md for examples of commands

### knife.rb

To set 'client' as the default mode, add the following line to the knife.rb file.

    knife[:vault_mode] = 'client'

To set the default list of admins for creating and updating vaults, add the
following line to the knife.rb file.

    knife[:vault_admins] = [ 'example-alice', 'example-bob', 'example-carol' ]

(These values can be overridden on the command line by using -A)

NOTE: chef-vault 1.0 knife commands are not supported! Please use chef-vault
2.0 commands.

    knife vault create VAULT ITEM VALUES
    knife vault edit VAULT ITEM
    knife vault refresh VAULT ITEM

## USAGE IN RECIPES

To use this gem in a recipe to decrypt data you must first install the gem
via a chef_gem resource. Once the gem is installed require the gem and then
you can create a new instance of ChefVault.

NOTE: chef-vault 1.0 style decryption is supported, however it has been
deprecated and chef-vault 2.0 decryption should be used instead

### Example Code

    chef_gem 'chef-vault' do
      compile_time true if respond_to?(:compile_time)
    end

    require 'chef-vault'

    item = ChefVault::Item.load("passwords", "root")
    item["password"]

Note that in this case, the gem needs to be installed at compile time
because the require statement is at the top-level of the recipe.  If
you move the require of chef-vault and the call to `::load` to
library or provider code, you can install the gem in the converge phase
instead.

### Specifying an alternate node name or client key path

Normally, the value of `Chef::Config[:node_name]` is used to find the
per-node encrypted secret in the keys data bag item, and the value of
`Chef::Config[:client_key]` is used to locate the private key to decrypt
this secret.

These can be overridden by passing a hash with the keys `:node_name` or
`:client_key_path` to `ChefVault::Item.load`:

    item = ChefVault::Item.load(
      'passwords', 'root',
      node_name: 'service_foo',
      client_key_path: '/secure/place/service_foo.pem'
    )
    item['password']

The above example assumes that you have transferred
`/secure/place/service_foo.pem` to your system via a secure channel.

This usage allows you to decrypt a vault using a key shared among several
nodes, which can be helpful when working in cloud environments or other
configurations where nodes are created dynamically.

### chef_vault_item helper

The [chef-vault cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef-vault)
contains a recipe to install the chef-vault gem and a helper method
`chef_vault_helper` which makes it easier to test cookbooks that use
chef-vault using Test Kitchen.

## DETERMINING IF AN ITEM IS A VAULT

ChefVault provides a helper method to determine if a data bag item is a vault,
which can be helpful if you produce a recipe for community consumption and want
to support both normal data bags and vaults:

    if ChefVault::Item.vault?('passwords', 'root')
      item = ChefVault::Item.load('passwords', 'root')
    else
      item = Chef::DataBagItem.load('passwords', 'root')
    end

This functionality is also available from the command line as `knife vault isvault VAULT ITEM`.

## DETERMINING THE TYPE OF A DATA BAG ITEM

ChefVault provides a helper method to determine the type of a data bag item.
It returns one of the symbols :normal, :encrypted or :vault

    case ChefVault::Item.data_bag_item_type('passwords', 'root')
    when :normal
      ...
    when :encrypted
      ...
    when :vault
      ...
    end

This functionality is also available from the command line as `knife vault itemtype VAULT ITEM`.

## USAGE STAND ALONE

`chef-vault` can be used as a stand alone binary to decrypt values stored in
Chef. It requires that Chef is installed on the system and that you have a
valid knife.rb. This is useful if you want to mix `chef-vault` into non-Chef
recipe code, for example some other script where you want to protect a
password.

It does still require that the data bag has been encrypted for the user's or
client's pem and pushed to the Chef server. It mixes Chef into the gem and
uses it to go grab the data bag.

Use `chef-vault --help` to see all all available options

### Example usage (password)

    chef-vault -v passwords -i root -a password -k /etc/chef/knife.rb

## TESTING

To stub vault items in ChefSpec, use the
[chef-vault-testfixtures](https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-vault-testfixtures)
gem.

To fall back to unencrypted JSON files in Test Kitchen, use the
`chef_vault_item` helper in the aforementioned chef-vault cookbook.

## THE FUTURE OF chef-vault

It has become clear that supporting alternate keying mechanisms like GPG and
Amazon KMS is something that chef-vault users want, but the implementation
of chef-vault v2 makes this difficult, as much of the code is tied to the
"side-along data bag item" implementation.

chef-vault v3.x.x will be a major rewrite. While the core vault item will
remain a Chef encrypted data bag item, the way in which you get the secret
to decrypt that data bag item will be delegated to plugins. At release,
there will be at least a plugin that emulates the 2.x.x implementation, and
hopefully one for KMS. Anyone who wants to support an alternate keying
implementation will be able to write one and distribute it as a gem for
others to use.

With that in mind, the 2.6.0 release is the last one that will receive new
features. If you refer to the
[milestones](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chef-vault/milestones) on Github,
the plan is for two releases prior to 3.x:

* v2.7.x will focus on reducing tech debt - getting the test coverage up to 100%
in both RSpec and Aruba, and getting the internal API docs completed.
* v2.99.x will be a transitional release. This release will add deprecation
warnings for any API or CLI option that will be changing in v3.x. Any user
who wants to stay with the 2.x series can use a '~> 2.x' constraint (where x
is any minor release of chef-vault) and be certain that they won't
accidentally get the new release.

If you are interested helping with the robustness fixes in v2.7.x, please
feel free to fork the repo and add more RSpec and Aruba tests. Frequent
small pull requests are preferred to large omnibus patches, as the
robustness pass is a multi-person effort and we don't want to create merge
conflicts unnecessarily.

We also have a [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/Nordstrom/chef-vault)
where you can discuss chef-vault and the robustness improvements.
