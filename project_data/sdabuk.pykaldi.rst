Fork of Kaldi for developing online-lattice recogniser
======================================================

Summary
-------
The fork presents three new Kaldi features:

* Online Lattice Recogniser. The Python wrapper implements  MFCC, LDA+MLLT, bMMI acoustic models since it was the best speaker independent setup.
  UPDATE: Since 11/18/2014 the Pykaldi fork uses the Kaldi official code (``src/online2``) which has very similar as our previous implementation (and was finished 08/2014).
* Python wrapper which interfaces the ``OnlineLatticeRecogniser`` to Python.
* Training scripts which can be used with standard Kaldi tools or with the new ``OnlineLatticeRecogniser``.
  The scripts for Czech and English support acoustic models obtained using MFCC, LDA+MLLT/delta+delta-delta feature transformations and acoustic models trained generatively or by MPE or bMMI training.

The new functionality is separated to different directories:
 * pykaldi/src/onl-rec stores C++ code for ``OnlineLatticeRecogniser``.
 * pykaldi/pykaldi stores Python wrapper ``PyOnlineLatticeRecogniser``.
 * kaldi/egs/vystadial/s5 stores training scripts.
 * kaldi/egs/vystadial/online_demo shows Kaldi standard decoder, ``OnlineLatticeRecogniser`` and ``PyOnlineLatticeRecogniser``, which produce the exact same lattices using the same setup.

The ``OnlineLatticeRecogniser`` is used in Alex dialogue system (https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/alex).

In March 2014, the ``PyOnlineLatticeRecogniser`` recogniser was evaluated on Alex domain.
See graphs evaluating ``OnlineLatticeRecogniser`` performance at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/oplatek/pykaldi-eval/blob/master/Pykaldi-evaluation.ipynb.

An example posterior word lattice output for one Czech utterance can be seen at http://oplatek.blogspot.it/2014/02/ipython-demo-pykaldi-decoders-on-short.html
