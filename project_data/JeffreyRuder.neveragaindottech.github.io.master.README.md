## Signing by pull request

To sign [the pledge](http://neveragain.tech/), please submit a pull request:

1. Go to the [`_signatures`](/_signatures/) folder.
2. Click the "Create new file" button in the upper-right corner.
3. Name the file something unique, for example: `first_name_last_name_affiliation.md`. The filename must have `.md` at the end.
4. Copy the text of the [`template.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neveragaindottech/neveragaindottech.github.io/master/template.md) file and paste it in the newly created signature file from step 3.
5. Edit the file to fill in the fields exactly as you want them to be shown.
6. Commit the file and make a pull request.
7. In your pull request description, include a link to a publicly verified profile (e.g. Keybase or LinkedIn) or a personal website, that shows ownership of your GitHub account and establishes your affiliation (if any).
8. A volunteer will review and merge in your pull request.

In order to be accepted, your pull request must contain enough information
for us to establish that the name and affiliation (if any) in the signature
accurately represent the owner of the submitting GitHub account.
