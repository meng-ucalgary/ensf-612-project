# OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

This is the official Github Repository of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). The MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the [OWASP Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs). The current master branch can also be [read on Gitbook](https://b-mueller.gitbooks.io/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/content/).

## Join the MSTG Working Session at the OWASP Summit 2017

The [OWASP summit 2017](http://owaspsummit.org) will have a whole 5-days track dedicated to the the Mobile Testing Guide! This will be a great opportunity to meet other mobile appsec experts and participate in the creation of the industry standard. Our ambitious goal for the summit to complete the MSTG. The summit will take place in Woburn Forest Center Parcs, Bedfordshir, 50 minutes from London, from June 12th to June 16th. [Sign up here](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/MSTG.html).

## Reading the Mobile Security Testing Guide

The MSTG hasn't been officially released yet. There are several options for converting it into an easily readable format:

1. Read it on [Gitbook](https://b-mueller.gitbooks.io/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/content/). The book is automatically synchronized with the main repo. You can use the gitbook command line tool to generate PDF, epub, and other e-book formats. Please note that we have disabled the ebook export features on gitbook.com for the time being - they will be enabled once the project reaches beta status.

2. Clone the repository and run the [document generator](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Tools/generate_document.sh) (requires [pandoc](http://pandoc.org)). This produces docx and html files in the "Generated" subdirectory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/
$ cd owasp-mstg/Tools/
$ ./generate_document.sh 
```

You can also use the [document index](https://rawgit.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/master/Generated/OWASP-MSTG-Table-of-Contents.html) to navigate the master branch of the MSTG.

## Contributions, feature requests and feedback

**We are searching for additional authors, reviewers and editors.** The best way to get started is to browse the [existing content](https://b-mueller.gitbooks.io/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/content/). Also, check the [project dashboard](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects/1) for a list of open tasks.

Drop a us line on the [Slack channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/) before you start working on a topic. This helps us to keep track of what everyone is doing and prevent conflicts. You can create a Slack account here:
