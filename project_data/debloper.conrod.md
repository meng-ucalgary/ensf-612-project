Current State
-------------

We're just starting to reach a stable-ish API pattern! There will still be large changes however these are more likely to be new features than API overhauls. Next on the todo list is `Theme`s!

An example project will be kept up-to-date featuring demonstrations of all working widgets. Conrod is still in very early stages however definitely usable.

Available Widgets
-----------------

- Button
- Drop Down List
- Envelope Editor
- Number Dialer
- Slider
- TextBox
- Toggle
- XYPad

Dependencies
------------

- [rustc](http://www.rust-lang.org/) - we try to keep up to date with the latest nightly build.
- [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) - for handling other rust dependencies and building the project.
- [freetype](http://www.freetype.org/download.html) - at the moment, Conrod uses [freetype-rs](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/freetype-rs) for its font rendering, which means you'll need to have the freetype library installed on your system. You can [download and install the freetype library here](http://www.freetype.org/download.html).


Getting Started
---------------

Build the conrod lib like this:

    git clone https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod.git
    cd conrod
    cargo build

And then build and run the examples like this:

    cargo run --example all_widgets
