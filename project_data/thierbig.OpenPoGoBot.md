# OpenPoGoBot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenPoGo/OpenPoGoBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenPoGo/OpenPoGoBot)

  A quick note:
  
  This is a fork of the project [PokemonGo-Bot](https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot) by [PokemonGoF](https://github.com/PokemonGoF).
  
  The goal of this fork is to progress the bot in an organized manner, and to promote a clean and functional codebase. As a result, OpenPoGoBot will be more reliable and secure than PokemonGo-Bot.

## Features
 * Spin Pokestops
 * Catch Pokemon
 * Release low cp pokemon
 * Walk to a location
 * Catch nearby pokemon when you have pokeballs available
 * Switch between catching pokemon and farming pokestops automatically
 * Filter certain pokemon
 * Use superior ball types when necessary
 * When out of normal pokeballs, use the next type of ball unless there are less than 10 of that type, in which case start automatically farming pokestops
 * Bot Navigation via Google Directions API
* Incubate eggs

### Command Line Example
Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) account:
```
$ python2 pokecli.py -a ptc -u tejado -p 1234 --location "New York, Washington Square"
```
Google Account:
```
$ python2 pokecli.py -a google -u tejado -p 1234 --location "New York, Washington Square"
```

### Bot Configuration via JSON
To load arguments for the bot from a JSON file, use the ``--config-json`` argument with the name of a file.
Any other command line arguments specified will override the parameters specified in the loaded JSON file.

Example - this will load config.json but use cp=1000 and iv=0.7 even if already defined in config.json:
```
$ python2 pokecli.py --config-json config.json -cp 1000 -iv 0.7
```

### JSON Options


### Advance Releasing Configuration
To edit the pokemon release configuration, copy the file ``release_config.json.example`` and rename it to ``release_config.json``

Edit this file however you want, but keep in mind:

1. Pokemon names should always be capitalized and are case-sensitive
2. The ``any`` configuration effects every pokemon
   

## FAQ

### What's IV ?
Here's the [introduction](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values)
### Losing Starter Pokemon and others
You can use -cp 1 to protect your first stage low CP pokemon.
### Set GEO Location
Use either `-l "lat, long"` or `--location "lat, long"` 
### Google login issues (Login Error, Server busy)?

Try to generate an [app password](!https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and set is as
```
-p "<your-app-password>"
```
This error is mostly occurs for those who using 2 factor authentication but either way for the purpose of security would be nice to have a separate password for the bot app.


### FLEE
The status code "3" corresponds to "Flee" - meaning your Pokemon has ran away.
   {"responses": { "CATCH_POKEMON": { "status": 3 } }
### Why aren't my pokemon showing up in my Pokedex?
Finish the tutorial on a smartphone. This will then allow everything to be visible.
### Where's `--mode`/`-m`?
Now, instead of using `--mode` you need to exclude plugins. If you don't want to catch pokemon, exclude the `catch_pokemon` plugin  (`-ep catch_pokemon`), and if you don't want to farm pokestops just exclude the `spin_pokestop` plugin (`-ep spin_pokestop`). Alternatively, you can modify your configuration JSON file to do the same thing.

### How can I have the bot ignore certain pokemon?
Create the following filter
```
./data/catch-ignore.yml
```
Its a yaml file with a list of names so make it look like
```
ignore:
  - Pidgey
  - Rattata
  - Pidgeotto
  - Spearow
  - Ekans
  - Zubat
```
### How do I use the map?

The web plugin uses `Flask` to open a server on port `8000`. Before visiting the site, you will need to set your username(s) in the `userdata.js` file:

1. Copy `userdata.js.example` to `userdata.js` 
2. Open the `userdata.js` file in your editor.
3. Edit the the username to match yours.
4. Change other settings if you want.
5. Browse `http://localhost:8000` and enjoy!

If you are using multiple usernames, the format is like this:  
```
var users = ["username1","username2"];
```
