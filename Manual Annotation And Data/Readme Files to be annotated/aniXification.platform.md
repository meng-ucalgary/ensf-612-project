## What is Ushahidi?

Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info from: SMS, Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information, categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

## What is Ushahidi v3?

Ushahidi v3 is the next iteration of this tool, rebuilt from the ground up -- not only the code but the way in which we think about users interacting with mobile and social data.

Crowdsourcing strategies have come a long way in the five years Ushahidi has been around and we've been fortunate enough to learn a lot from our global community.

### Should I use Ushahidi v3 for my new project?

That depends.. we've released v3 to the public and it should be usable in production.
However it's still missing a few features we had in v2. We recommend you give it a try and see if it meets your needs. If somethings missing let us know! It helps us prioritise future development

### I'm a developer, should I contribute to Ushahidi v3?

Yes! Development moves pretty quickly but the tech stack is getting more and more stable. If you're keen to help build something awesome, [Jump on board..][getin]

## Using the Platform

Please see our [Installation Guide][install] to get set up first!

### Logging in for the first time

The default install creates the user `admin` with a password of `admin`.
This user has admin privileges. Once logged in, this user can create more user
accounts or give admin permissions to others as well.

Extras
------

### Vagrantfile

We've included a Vagrantfile and puppet manifests to help build a quick development box.
Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), then run `vagrant up` to get started!

### Travis-CI

Unit and functional tests are run automatically by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/ushahidi/platform).
