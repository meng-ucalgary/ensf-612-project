**Stupid Pet Tricks** 
**Presentation/Due → March 3**

Using the skills you have learned thus far in class, create a physical computing project using both input and output.  Your project should have at least 2 forms of output (not including the off state) based on 2 forms or levels of input.  This does not mean that you must activate multiple things based on multiple sensors.  Rather, that you are evaluating your input and adjusting your output as a result.  (You can use multiple inputs and outputs if you like.)

Think of having different behaviors that occurs once in a while. Think of different blink patterns. Perhaps these are based on different types of input, or different durations of input. It's possible to have one sensor and one load, with each having different states. For example, if I press my switch 3 times in a row, my light turns on for 3 minutes. If I press it 2 times, my light blinks, etc. etc.

Your project must respond to a physical action or series of actions a person takes, and it must be amusing, surprising, or otherwise engaging. It doesn't have to be practical, or complex, as long it shows that you understand the basics of digital and analog I/O and how to use them.  You could consider this a quick prototype for a much larger project, or a proof of concept.

Do not just copy code from the tutorials or the examples. Do not just copy the code and swap out a few variables. Manipulate and craft the code to your idea. If you find code from elsewhere to manipulate, make a reference to it in the comments.

Craftsmanship should have some attention paid to it.  While this project may not have perfect craftsmanship, it should be considered.


#Requirements:
1.	Perfect circuit competence – appropriate resistors, electrical interfaces, wiring, colors, power supplies
2.	A custom fabricated switch
3.	Competent code – commented out, utilization of serial print statements
4.	3-4 Drawings/sketches of your project, it's setup and details.
5.	Pseudo code for all of the code
6.	Your breadboard circuit schematic, created using Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/download/
7.	Documentation of the process on in a PDF – 5-6 annotated images
8.  Upload your code to your fork of this repo. Upon pushing your code to your branch, submit a pull request to me.
9. Upload your PDF and any other process information and sketches to your blog.
